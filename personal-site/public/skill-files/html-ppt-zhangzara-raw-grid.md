# Raw Grid

> Neo-brutalist deck with thick borders, offset shadows, and a pink/sage/ink palette.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** medium-low
- **Density:** high
- **Slides in demo:** 10

## Best for

Anything that should feel direct and graphic-confident: founder pitches, accelerator demos, brand decks, indie launches, creator portfolios. Strong for stat slides, comparison tables, and process flows. Equally good for tech, research, or finance when the speaker wants the deck to feel scrappy-confident rather than buttoned-up.

## Avoid for

Contexts that need to feel soft, warm, or intentionally quiet — the brutalist borders and offset shadows commit to a graphic voice.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.
