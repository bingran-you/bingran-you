Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) typically utilize the top-k contexts from a retriever in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the s-
ame LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain-
 without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.
1 Introduction
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard & Grave, 2021; Lin et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) is a widely used technique for customizing large language models (LLMs) to handle long-tail knowledge (Mallen et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024b), provide up-to-date information (Kasai et al., 2023), and adapt to specific domains and tasks (Xiong et al., 2024) without modifying the model weights. In general, a dense embedding based retriever (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2023;-
 Wang et al., 2022) first retrieves top-k chunked contexts from a collection documents or external database for a given question. Then, LLM reads the top-k contexts to generate the answer.
However, the current RAG pipeline has the following limitations: i) LLMs are not good at reading too many chunked contexts (e.g., top-100) even with the long-context window, not only due to efficiency reasons, but also because a shorter list of top-k (e.g., 5, 10) contexts usually leads to higher accuracy of generation (e.g., see Table 5 in Xu et al., 2024b). ii) Given a small k, one needs a mechanism to ensure the high recall of relevant contents. Relying solely on a retrieval model may be inadeq-
uate due to challenges in learning effective local alignments across the entire embedding space to support accurate matching (Luan et al., 2021). In practice, a separate ranking model (Nogueira et al., 2020; Glass et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023) that cross-encodes question and candidate context can work better than a dense embedding-based retriever for obtaining the most relevant top-k contexts from top-N candidates (N ≫ k). iii) However, the zero-shot generalization capability of the expert rankin-
g model can be relatively limited compared to the versatile LLM itself.

 Based on the above considerations, our goal is to design an RAG instruction tuning pipeline that uses a single language model to achieve both high-recall context extraction and high-quality content generation. In previous study, instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate a strong ability to extract answers from relevant context for a given question (e.g., OpenAI, 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024). This capability can be viewed as the “dual capability” of determining whether a chunk of context is -
relevant to the question thus is useful for generating the answer. We hypothesize that these capabilities mutually enhance each other. Motivated by this insight, we propose RankRAG, which intruction-tunes a single LLM for both context ranking and answer generation in RAG framework. Furthermore, RankRAG expands upon existing instruction-tuning data by incorporating context-rich QA, retrieval-augmented QA and ranking datasets, enhancing the LLM’s ability to filter out irrelevant contexts during both-
 the retrieval and generation phases of RAG.
Our contribution can be summarized as follows:
• We propose RankRAG, a novel framework that enhances LLM’s RAG capability through simultaneously instructing the LLM on context ranking and answer generation. During training, we design a specialized task focused on identifying relevant contexts or passages for a given question. This task is structured for ranking and framed as regular question answering with instruction, aligning more effectively with retrieval-augmented generation tasks. At inference, the LLM first reranks the retrieved context-
s, then generates answer based on the refined top-k (e.g., 5). This framework is readily applicable to diverse knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.
• Remarkably, we observe that integrating a small fraction of ranking data into the instruction tuning blend of LLM works surprisingly well on the evaluations of ranking associated with the RAG tasks, even surpassing the LLMs fine-tuned with 10× more ranking data. We attribute this success to the transferable design of RankRAG training.
• We extensively compare the proposed RankRAG method with several strong baselines, including the open-sourced ChatQA-1.5. On nine general-domain and five biomedical knowledge-intensive benchmarks for RAG, Llama3-RankRAG-8B and Llama3-RankRAG-70B outperforms Llama3ChatQA-1.5-8B and Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B by a margin, respectively.
In the remainder of the paper, we discuss related work in § 2. We introduce problem setup in § 3 and RankRAG method in § 4. We present the experimental setup in § 5, and conclude the paper in § 6.
2 Related Work
Retrieval-augumented generation (RAG) has been established for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks (Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Izacard & Grave, 2021). In the standard process, a standalone dense-embedding-based retriever (e.g., Karpukhin et al., 2020) first retrieves relevant information from an external corpus, which the LLM then utilizes in the generation process. To improve this pipeline, recent research has focused on aligning retrievers to the needs of LLMs for-
 generation (Shi et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024), designing multi-step retrieval processes (Trivedi et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Jeong et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2023), or filtering irrelevant contexts (Wang et al., 2023c; Yoran et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a). To improve generation, several studies have designed instruction-tuning methods dedicated to enhancing the search (Ma et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2024) and RAG capability of LLMs (Liu et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2-
024; Luo et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024).
Although strong retrievers have been introduced (e.g., Lin et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022, 2023a; Lee et al., 2024), one potential approach to improve retriever is optimizing it along with LLM in an end-to-end manner (e.g., Guu et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2024; Sachan et al., 2021; Izacard et al., 2023). However, this requires surrogate loss for optimization and complicates the training pipeline, especially when the embedding database needs to be re-indexed frequently due to the up-
date of the embedding model (i.e., retriever).
Ranking serves as an intermediate step to improve the quality of information retrieval (Mitra et al., 2018), and has been applied to RAG pipeline for improving generation quality (Glass et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023). However, these methods still rely on an additional moderate-sized model (e.g. BERT, T5) for ranking, which is often insufficient to capture the relevance between query and contexts and may lack the zero-shot generalization capability. Although recent studies have demonstrated the st-
rong ability of LLMs at ranking tasks (Khalifa et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023), how to harvest this ability for the RAG pipeline remains underexplored.

3 Preliminaries
In this section, we first introduce the preliminaries of retrieval-augmented generation as well as the problem setup. Then we present the limitations in the current RAG pipeline, which motivates the proposed RankRAG method.
3.1 Problem Setup
In retrieval-augmented generation, a collection of documents or contexts (e.g. Wikipedia) is given, providing the grounded knowledge. Given a question q, the retriever R (e.g., a parameterized embedding model) first retrieves top-k contexts C = {c1, · · · , ck} that are most relevant to the question. Subsequently, the language model produces the final answer where the answer can either be a short phrase or a long sentence, depending on the type of the target task. Our focus is on autoregressive la-
nguage models (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Meta-AI, 2024), which is the most common architectures for LLMs.
3.2 Limitation of Current RAG Pipelines
Before formally introducing RankRAG, we would like to first pinpoint several limitations of the current “retrieve-then-generate” pipeline with large language models.
Limited Capacity of Retriever. Current RAG systems usually employ sparse retrieval (e.g. BM25 (Robertson et al., 2004)) or moderate-size (e.g. BERT-based) embedding model (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022) as the retriever R, mainly due to efficiency consideration as there are often millions of, if not more, documents need to be indexed. These models encode questions and documents independently and calculate the similarity between question and documents using vector simi-
larity metrics. However, the limited capacity of embedding model and independent processing of query and documents constrain the ability to estimate textual relevance between question q and documents d, reducing their effectiveness in new tasks or domains, verified by both theoretical (Menon et al., 2022) and empirical (Luan et al., 2021; Thakur et al., 2021) studies.
Trade-off of Picking Top-k Contexts. Although the state-of-the-art long-context LLM can take many retrieved contexts as input for answer generation, the performance quickly saturates with increased k in practice. For example, Xu et al. (2024b) finds the optimal number of chunked context k is around 10 for long document QA tasks. As illurstrated in Figure 1, we perform evaluation on ChatQA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024), one of the strongest RAG model with open weights, and find the saturation of accuracy -
when k = 10. In general, a smaller k often fails to capture all relevant information, compromising the recall, given the limited expressibility of retriver. In contrast, a larger k improves recall but at the cost of introducing irrelevant content that hampers the LLM’s ability to generate accurate answers (Yoran et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023b).
4 RankRAG
To address the limitations mentioned in the previous section, we propose the RankRAG method to enhance the LLM’s ability for retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, we instruction-tune the LLM to simultaneously capture the relevance between the question and context and utilize the retrieved context for answer generation. The details are introduced as follows.

4.1 Stage-I: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
It is observed that general instruction-tuning or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often significantly improves the ability of LLMs to follow instructions, thus improving zero-shot results on various downstream tasks (Wei et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). As such, we follow existing works (Chung et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024) to first leverage SFT on a blend of high quality instruction following datasets, including: i) a private crowd-sourced conversational dataset and public con-
versation datasets: OpenAssistant (Köpf et al., 2023), Dolly (Conover et al., 2023), and SODA (Kim et al., 2023), ii) a long-form QA dataset ELI5 that requires elaborate answers (Fan et al., 2019), iii) LLM-generated instructions: Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b) and Unnatural Instructions (Honovich et al., 2023), iv) FLAN and Chain-of-thought datasets (Chung et al., 2024).
There are overall 128K SFT examples in total. We make sure that there is no overlap between SFT data and data from evaluation tasks. For each sample in the instruction-following dataset, we take the multi-turn conversational format, use the previous turns of conversation between the user and the assistant as the context, and compute the loss only at the last response from the assistant.
4.2 Stage-II: Unified Instruction-Tuning for Ranking and Generation
The Stage-I SFT enpowers the LLMs with basic instruction-following capabilities; however, their performance on RAG tasks often remains suboptimal, as the LLMs are not optimized for extracting answers from retrieved context for a given question. Although recent studies (Lin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) enhance the RAG capability of LLM by instruction tuning it on context-rich generation tasks, these approaches can still be ineffective with poor initial retrieval results. Rank-
RAG instruction tunes the LLM for both retrieval-augmented generation and context ranking. In particular, the context ranking capability is crucial to obtain more relevant top-k context with imperfect retriever.
To achieve this goal, the instruction tuning blend of Stage-II consists the following five parts:
1) SFT data from Stage-I. This part is included to maintain LLM’s instruction-following capability.
2) Context-rich QA data. We first follow Liu et al. (2024) to leverage multiple context-rich QA tasks to enhance the LLM’s capability of using context for generation. The training blend we use consists of: i) standard QA and reading comprehension datasets: DROP (Dua et al., 2019), NarrativeQA (Kocˇisky` et al., 2018), Quoref (Dasigi et al., 2019), ROPES (Lin et al., 2019), NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017), TAT-QA (Zhu et al., 2021), which contains a question, a golden context and an answer. ii) con-
versational QA datasets: HumanAnnotatedConvQA and SyntheticConvQA open-sourced by Liu et al. (2024), which contains a conversation between user and assistant, as well as one background document. The model needs to generate an answer given the conversation history and document.
3) Retrieval-augmented QA data. In addition to the above QA datasets used in Liu et al. (2024), we add two datasets with not only gold context but also the top-retrieved context using BM25. Note that, it is crucial to improve LLM’s robustness over irrelevant context at generation. Being aware of this, we consider two QA tasks, namely SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013). For each question with the answer, we combine the gold context with the top-retrieved contexts -
using BM25, ensuring a total of five contexts. Note that some retrieved contexts may not contain the answer, and could be the “hard-negative” contexts.
4) Context ranking data. To empower LLMs with ranking capabilities, we use the popular MS MARCO passage (context) ranking dataset (Bajaj et al., 2016). We treat the gold query-passage

pairs (q, c+) as relevant while using hard negative passages (q, c−) mined via BM25 as irrelevant pairs. The LLM need to generate “True” or “False” given the corresponding query-passage pair, where the question along with the task-specific instruction is “For the question {question}, access whether the passage is relevant to the question.”.
We want to handle ranking in conversational senario as well. While MS MARCO spans various topics, the questions are only single-turn short sentences. However, ranking data are only available, if any, at a small amount for conversation QA. To overcome this limitation, we repurpose the conversational QA pairs to generate pseudo relevance pairs. As each conversation is only associated with one document d, we cut each document into 150-word chunks (c1, c2, . . . , cn). We compute the 4-gram recall sco-
re between each chunk ci and the ground-truth answer a, considering segments with a recall score above 0.5 as relevant and those below 0.1 as irrelevant for the corresponding conversation. Note that, each sample contains one question-context pair for this ranking dataset. In total, there are around 50k ranking pairs from MS MARCO ranking and synthetic conversations for instruction finetuning.
5) Retrieval-augmented ranking data. We aim to train the LLM with the capability of determining the relevance of multiple contexts simultaneously given a question, which is closer to the test-time behavior of RAG with top-k contexts. As before, we utilize two QA datasets, SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013). We combine the gold context with the topretrieved contexts using BM25, ensuring a total of five contexts. The contexts containing the answer are considered re-
levant, and the LLM is trained to explicitly identify all relevant contexts for the question.
Unifying RAG and ranking with instruction tuning. It is worth noting that, despite the variety of datasets and tasks described, they can all be cast into a standardized QA format (x, c, y), where x is the question, c is the corresponding context, and y is the target output answer. For example, for the retrieval-augmented ranking data, the question is “For the question <question>, find all the passages from the context that are relevant to the question.” Table 1 exhibits how to cast different tasks-
 into a unified format. Despite its simplicity, this approach has the following advantages: i) It empowers the LLM with the ranking capability by adding relatively small amount of ranking data. ii) By standardizing these tasks into a unified format, they can mutually enhance each other. After that, we obtain the final RankRAG model that can be applied to various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.
4.3 RankRAG Inference: Retrieve-Rerank-Generate Pipeline
As RankRAG incorporates an additional reranking step, the inference pipeline for each question is modified as a retrieve-rerank-generate pipeline, described as follows: (1) the retriever R first retrieves top-N contexts from the corpus. (2) the RankRAG model calculates the relevance score between the question and retrieved N contexts as the probability of generating the answer as True using the prompt in Table 1, then reranks contexts to only retain top-k (k ≪ N ) contexts, which are then used as -
the input for the generation step. (3) The top-k contexts, along with the question, are concatenated and fed back into the RankRAG model to generate the final answer.
Efficiency Discussion. We are aware that the addition of a reranking step introduces extra processing time. In practice, for each question, denote the time for indexing and retrieval as t1, the time for using LLM to calculate the relevance score as t2 and the time for generation as t3, then the ratio of added time overhead is N∗t2
t1+t3 . In practice, calculating relevance typically requires generating just one token and involves much shorter inputs compared to the generation step with top-k contexts. We provide efficiency study in §5.5.

 5 Experiments
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks to demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of RankRAG.
5.1 Experiment Setup
Tasks and Datasets. We consider 3 types of tasks in experiments: (1) Open-domain QA (OpenQA), which includes NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and 2WikimQA (Ho et al., 2020). The first three are singlehop QA tasks, while the last two are multi-hop QA datasets. For NQ, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA, we use the split from KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) 2. (2) Fact verification, where we use FEVER (Thorne et al., 20-
18) from KILT benchmark. (3) Conversational QA (ConvQA), we consider three datasets including Doc2Dial (Feng et al., 2020), TopiOCQA (Adlakha et al., 2022) and INSCIT (Wu et al., 2023), which have long documents that cannot be fitted directly into LLMs thus necessitates retrieval and ranking. The detailed dataset information is in Appendix A.1.
Baselines. We consider the following baselines: (1) Baseline LLMs without RAG, where we consider LLMs trained with proprietary data including InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023), FLAN-LaMDA (Longpre et al., 2023), GLaM (Du et al., 2022), Claude 2 (Anthropic, 2023), Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct (Mistral, 2024), DeepSeek-V2 Chat (DeepSeek, 2024) and only use the official reported results. We also consider two ChatGPT-series models, namely GPT-3.5-turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) (OpenA-
I, 2022) and GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) (OpenAI, 2023). (2) Baselines with retrieval, we evaluate models augmented with retrieval. Specifically, we include Atlas (Izacard et al., 2023) and Raven (Huang et al., 2023), two RAG models based on encoderdecoder LMs. For decoder-only models, we consider Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024a), RECOMP (Xu et al., 2024a), InstructRetro (Wang et al., 2024), RePlug (Shi et al., 2024), RA-DIT (Lin et al., 2024), Llama-3-instruct (Meta-AI, 2024) and ChatQA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024-
). We also list the result of RAG pipelines using InstructGPT (175B parameters) as the backbone including GenRead (Yu et al., 2023a), Retrieve-read (Lazaridou et al., 2022) and ReFeed (Yu et al., 2024), but mainly for reference. Other reported numbers are directly comparable if they follow the standard zero-shot settings.
Evaluation Metrics. For OpenQA datasets, we use Exact Match (EM) as the main metric but also report Accuracy for TriviaQA and PopQA and F1 score for HotpotQA and 2WikimQA as it is used in several studies (Asai et al., 2024a; Mallen et al., 2023). For FEVER, we use accuracy as the metric. For ConvQA datasets, we follow (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) to use F1 score as the metric.
Implementation Details. We use Llama3 8B and 70B (Meta-AI, 2024) as the backbone in our main experiments. For the two-stage instruction tuning, we set the batch size to 128 and train the model for 1000 steps with learning rate 5e-6 in Stage-I. Then, we reduce the learning rate to 3e-7 for 8B and 2e-7 for 70B model, set the batch size to 64, and train the model for 3300 steps (around 1 epoch). We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.98. During the inference stage, we -
use the December 2018 Wikidump as the corpus index for NQ, TQA, HotpotQA, 2WikimQA, and use the December 2020 Wikidump for PopQA, following (Asai et al., 2024a). By default, we follow (Wang et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024) to use the Dragon retriever (Lin et al., 2023) as default and retrieve top-N (100 for 8B and 30 for 70B) documents for ranking, but RankRAG can be adapted to various retrievers and different N (see § 5.3 and 5.5). To ensure a fair comparison, we test the perform-
ance of k ∈ {5, 10, 20} and report the best performance for baselines. For generation, we keep temperature T = 0 and set the maximum number of generated token to be 32 for OpenQA, 128 for ConvQA and 8 for others. Training RankRAG-8B uses 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 10 hours (4 hours for Stage-I and 6 hours for Stage-II finetuning), while training RankRAG-70B uses 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 16 hours (4 hours for Stage-I and 12 hours for Stage-II Finetuning).
Data Contamination Issues. One possible issue for the zero-shot evaluation is the test set contamination, where some of the task-specific examples overlap with the instruction fine-tuning data (Oren et al., 2024). To address this issue, we have performed a string match-based analysis where we do not observe any overlap between the train data and data from target tasks.

RankRAG outperforms existing RAG methods. With 8B scale, RankRAG consistently outperforms ChatQA-1.5 8B, one of the most recent open-sourced model with state-of-the-art performance on many RAG benchmarks. RankRAG 8B is also competitive when compared with baseline models with much more parameters. For example, it significantly outperforms InstructRetro (5× parameters), RA-DIT 65B (8× paramters), and even outperforms Llama3-instruct 70B (8× parameters) on NQ and TriviaQA tasks. With more parameters,-
 RankRAG 70B outperforms the strong ChatQA-1.5 70B model, and largely outperforms previous RAG baselines with InstructGPT as the underlying LLM.
RankRAG demonstrates larger improvement on more challenging datasets. We observe that the performance gains of RankRAG over baselines are more pronounced for more challenging QA datasets. For example, on long-tailed QA (PopQA) and multi-hop QA (2WikimQA) tasks, we achieve more than 10% improvement over ChatQA-1.5. These findings suggest that in challenging OpenQA datasets where top documents from retrievers are less relevant to the answer, context ranking effectively enhances performance. In this -
work we focus on improving single-time retrieval for QA tasks. How to effectively combine multi-round RAG pipelines (Jiang et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2022; Jeong et al., 2024) with RankRAG is an interesting avenue of future work.
5.3 Ablation Studies
Effect of Designed Components. Table 3 shows the ablations of RankRAG with Llama3 8B as the backbone on nine general-domain datasets. Overall, we observe all of the proposed components contribute to the final performance. Removing context ranking hurts performance on all tasks, justifying its efficacy in selecting the most relevant contexts for the target question. Besides, the retrieval-augmented QA (RQA) and retrieval-augmented ranking (RAR) designed for instruction finetuning improve outcomes o-
n most tasks by helping the model explicitly pinpoint relevant contexts. On the contrary, the RAFT method used in (Lin et al., 2024) treats each retrieved context separately during instruction finetuning, which yields suboptimal results when compared to RankRAG with the same training data.

Performance with Different Retrievers. Figure 3 exhibits the performance of RankRAG and ChatQA1.5 with different dense retrievers on three representative tasks, where we consider DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022) as two variants. We note that although the initial retrieved result is not good enough, RankRAG still surpasses ChatQA-1.5 by more than 10% for both retrievers on average. To summarize, RankRAG is robust to the choice of retrievers.

To demonstrate that RankRAG can adapt to specialized domains, we conduct experiments on Mirage (Xiong et al., 2024), a recently introduced RAG benchmark for the biomedical field. We follow Xiong et al. (2024) to employ MedCPT (Jin et al., 2023) as the retriever R with MedCorp3 as the corpus D.
The experiment results of RankRAG and baselines are shown in Table 5. From the table, we observe that RankRAG, even without fine-tuning on the biomedical domain, excels at medical QA tasks. Notably, RankRAG 8B surpasses Meditron 70B—a leading open-source LLM for the medical domain—by 6.3%. Besides, RankRAG 70B attains more than 98% performance of GPT-4. These results justify RankRAG’s capacity to be readily applied to new domains without extra post-training.
5.5 A Closer Look at the Ranking Module
As the context ranking serves as a core step in RankRAG, we take a closer look at this component. All the studies are done using Llama3-8B as the backbone.

ChatQA-1.5 RankRAG
(c) HotpotQA Figure 5: Performance v.s. Efficiency analysis for RankRAG.
RankRAG is Data-efficient. Previous approaches that infuse context ranking into the RAG pipeline usually involve a separate reranking model. To compare our model with these baselines, we evaluate four models (BERT (Glass et al., 2022)/T5 (Nogueira et al., 2020)/Llama3 (Ma et al., 2023)) fine-tuned on the full MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, a strong off-the-shelf reranker model BGE-ranker, and two OpenAI GPT-series models. For the GPT-series models, we use the token probability of ‘True’ as a pr-
oxy for the relevance score4. These models are then used to rerank top-retrieved passages by Dragon, similar to our approach. Surprisingly, as shown in Table 6, RankRAG achieves better recall over dedicated ranking models trained on 10× more ranking data for most cases. Besides, RankRAG can still outperform the BGE-ranker on most tasks, which has been extensively trained on more than 1 million ranking pairs, including some that overlap with our evaluation tasks. This advantage is likely due to the-
 adaptable nature of our model’s training, where the ranking data closely resembles the general RAG fine-tuning data. Directly using ChatQA-1.5 to rank passages hurts the performance, indicating the necessity of incorporating ranking data into instruction fine-tuning.
We further study the relation between the number of context ranking data and final performance. As shown in Figure 4, with 5k ranking data only (∼ 1% of the MS MARCO dataset), RankRAG can already obtain very compelling results, while further increasing the number of ranking data to 50k yields non-marginal gains. This finding confirms RankRAG’s data efficiency – achieving effective performance with a modest amount of ranking data and maintaining adaptability across various tasks.
Performance v.s. Time-efficiency for RankRAG. One specific caveat for scaling up model size is the increment in the latency overhead — as mentioned in §4.3, it requires sample-wise ranking which incurs additional time. To study the relation between the time efficiency and performance, we change the N used in reranking and plot the relation of N and final accuracy in Figure 5, from which we observe that even with N = 20, RankRAG still improve the baseline model without reranking. While reranking ac-
ross N = 20 to 100 improves the exact match score by 5.9% to 9.1% across three tasks, it incurs an additional 0.9× to 6.0× increase in time – significantly less than the 20× to 100× increase one might expect.
5.6 Case Study
Table 7 presents a case study on NQ dataset, where we observe that using retriever only yield noisy contexts, as there are several distractors, and some contexts (e.g. Passage 4/5 for ChatQA-1.5) are

6 Conclusion
In this work, we introduce a new RAG framework, RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for both ranking and answer generation. We find that the instruction tuned LLMs can outperform existing expert ranking models by only adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend. We compare our RankRAG with the state-of-the-art RAG models on comprehensive knowledgeintensive benchmarks and demonstrate RankRAG significantly outperform all of them on nine general-domain and five biomedica-
l benchmarks for RAG.

 A Dataset Description
The information for 14 datasets used in RankRAG is listed as follows.
A.1 Main Experiments
• NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is a widely used question-answering dataset constructed with Wikipedia. The questions are constructed from the Google search engine, and the answers are identified as text spans in the Wikipedia article.
• TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) is a challenging QA dataset containing question-answer pairs from trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents.
• PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) is an entity-centric QA dataset concentrated on long-tail entities. For PopQA, we follow (Asai et al., 2024a) to use the long-tail subset, consisting of questions on 1399 rare entities whose monthly Wikipedia page views are less than 100.
• HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is a multi-hop QA dataset, where the goal is to answer complex questions that require understanding and linking information from multiple documents.
• 2WikimQA (Ho et al., 2020) is also a multi-hop QA designed to test machine understanding across two different Wikipedia entities, evaluating the ability of systems to handle cross-lingual and cross-cultural retrieval and question answering.
• FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) is a fact verification dataset aimed at supporting research into the automatic verification of factual claims. It consists of claims that are manually verified against evidence from Wikipedia, providing a benchmark for fact-checking systems.
• Doc2Dial (Feng et al., 2020) is a document-grounded conversational QA dataset covering four domains: DMV, SSA, VA, and Student Aid. Each sample comprises a dialogue where a user poses queries regarding the document, and an agent responds those questions. The average document length is around 101K words.
• TopiOCQA (Adlakha et al., 2022) is grounded on the whole Wikipedia. It incorporates topic switching and requires the agent to search the entire Wikipedia for answers to user questions.
• INSCIT (Wu et al., 2023) is also grounded on the whole Wikipedia. It studies the case where user questions are under-specified and require clarification.
A.2 Biomedical Benchmarks
• MMLU-med (Hendrycks et al., 2021) is a subset of six tasks related to biomedicine, including anatomy, clinical knowledge, professional medicine, human genetics, college medicine, and college biology. It contains 1089 questions in total.
• MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) is collected from the US Medical Licensing Examination, contaiing 1273 four-option multiple-choice questions focused on real-world scenarios from professional medical board exams.
• MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022) includes multiple-choice questions derived from Indian medical entrance exams, covering 2400 healthcare topics across 21 medical subjects. We use the 4,183question development set from MedMCQA, as the test set lacks provided ground truths.
• PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019) is a biomedical research QA dataset consisting of 1000 manually annotated questions based on PubMed abstracts. Answers in PubMedQA are structured as yes/no/maybe to reflect the validity of the questions.
• BioASQ (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) includes 618 questions constructed from biomedical literature without providing the ground truth snippets, challenging RAG systems to infer answers independently.

E Additional Experiment Results
E.1 Ranking Performance Using DPR and Contriever as Retrievers R
Table 8 shows the ranking performance of RankRAG-8B using DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) on three datasets. There are consistent performance gains for all tasks, indicating that RankRAG can apply to many popular retrieval models to improve the quality of retrieved contents.

E.2 RAG Performance with Different k
We also show the performance of RankRAG with different context size k in figure 6. From the result, we observe that different from the trend of vanilla RAG approaches (without ranking), k = 5 already works well for most datasets. This effectiveness stems from the reranking step, which prioritizes the most relevant contexts at the top, reducing the necessity to include additional contexts.

F Performance of NQ and Trivia QA on DPR Splits
We observe that the NQ and TriviaQA datasets exist in two versions: one used by the DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and FiD (Izacard & Grave, 2021) papers, which include 3610 and 11316 questions for NQ and TriviaQA, respectively. In contrast, the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) utilizes only subsets of these, comprising 2837 and 5355 examples for NQ and TriviaQA, respectively. It is noteworthy that many recent studies report performance metrics on these datasets without clarifying which version-
 was employed for evaluation.
To facilitate an honest and fair comparison, we present the performance of RankRAG on both datasets using the DPR splits in Table 9. Notably, regardless of the subset used, RankRAG consistently outperforms both ChatQA and Llama-3-instruct, our direct competitors, as well as other methods utilizing InstructGPT as backbones. We aim for these results to assist the community in making accurate comparisons when referring to the performance of RankRAG.

G Additional Case Studies
Tables 10 and 11 provide additional examples from the PopQA and HotpotQA datasets, which focus on long-tailed and multi-hop QA. These tasks are particularly challenging for retrievers, making it difficult to obtain relevant context from the corpus. Consequently, ChatQA-1.5 often struggles to produce the correct answers. However, the reranking step in RankRAG helps counteract poor initial
