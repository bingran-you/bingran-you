Abstract
Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation—modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Age-
ntic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong basel-
ines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, -
efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

 adaptation improves performance after model training by incorporating clarified instructions, structured reasoning steps, or domain-specific input formats directly into the model’s inputs. Contexts underpin many AI system components, including system prompts that guide downstream tasks [4, 36], memory that carries past facts and experiences [41, 48], and factual evidence that reduces hallucination and supplements knowledge [6].
Adapting through contexts rather than weights offers several key advantages. Contexts are interpretable and explainable for users and developers [45, 47], allow rapid integration of new knowledge at runtime [7, 27], and can be shared across models or modules in a compound system [23]. Meanwhile, advances in longcontext LLMs [39] and context-efficient inference such as KV cache reuse [17, 51] are making context-based approaches increasingly practical for deployment. As a result, context adaptation -
is emerging as a central paradigm for building capable, scalable, and self-improving AI systems.
Despite this progress, existing approaches to context adaptation face two key limitations. First, a brevity bias: many prompt optimizers prioritize concise, broadly applicable instructions over comprehensive accumulation. For example, GEPA [4] highlights brevity as a strength, but such abstraction can omit domain-specific heuristics, tool-use guidelines, or common failure modes that matter in practice [16]. This objective aligns with validation metrics in some settings, but often fails to capture -
the detailed strategies required by agents and knowledge-intensive applications. Second, context collapse: methods that rely on monolithic rewriting by an LLM often degrade into shorter, less informative summaries over time, causing sharp performance declines (Figure 2). In domains such as interactive agents [38, 43, 57], domain-specific programming [53, 56], and financial or legal analysis [18, 33, 44], strong performance depends on retaining detailed, task-specific knowledge rather than compress-
ing it away.
As applications such as agents and knowledge-intensive reasoning demand greater reliability, recent work has shifted toward saturating contexts with abundant, potentially useful information [11, 12, 22], enabled by advances in long-context LLMs [34, 39]. We argue that contexts should function not as concise summaries, but as comprehensive, evolving playbooks—detailed, inclusive, and rich with domain insights. Unlike humans, who often benefit from concise generalization, LLMs are more effective whe-
n provided with long, detailed contexts and can distill relevance autonomously [22, 31, 41]. Thus, instead of compressing away domain-specific heuristics and tactics, contexts should preserve them, allowing the model to decide what matters at inference time.
To address these limitations, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework for comprehensive context adaptation in both offline settings (e.g., system prompt optimization) and online settings (e.g., test-time memory adaptation). Rather than compressing contexts into distilled summaries, ACE treats them as evolving playbooks that accumulate and organize strategies over time. Building on the agentic architecture of Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], ACE incorporates a modular workflow of genera-
tion, reflection, and curation, while adding structured, incremental updates guided by a grow-and-refine principle. This design preserves detailed, domain-specific knowledge, prevents context collapse, and yields contexts that remain comprehensive and scalable throughout adaptation.
We evaluate ACE on two categories of LLM applications that most benefit from comprehensive, evolving contexts: (1) agents [43], which require multi-turn reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction, where accumulated strategies can be reused across episodes; and (2) domain-specific benchmarks, which demand specialized tactics and knowledge, where we focus on financial analysis [33, 44]. Our key findings are:
• ACE consistently outperforms strong baselines, yielding average gains of 10.6% on agents and 8.6% on domain-specific benchmarks, across both offline and online adaptation settings. • ACE is able to construct effective contexts without labeled supervision, instead leveraging execution feedback and environment signals—key ingredients for self-improving LLMs and agents. • On the AppWorld benchmark leaderboard [5], ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent IBMCUGA [35] (powered by GPT-4.1) o-
n average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, while using a smaller open-source model (DeepSeek-V3.1).

 • ACE requires significantly fewer rollouts and lower dollar costs, and achieves 86.9% lower adaptation latency (on average) than existing adaptive methods, demonstrating that scalable self-improvement can be achieved with both higher accuracy and lower overhead.
2 Background and Motivation
2.1 Context Adaptation
Context adaptation (or context engineering) refers to methods that improve model behavior by constructing or modifying inputs to an LLM, rather than altering its weights. The current state of the art leverages natural language feedback [4, 40, 54]. In this paradigm, a language model inspects the current context along with signals such as execution traces, reasoning steps, or validation results, and generates natural language feedback on how the context should be revised. This feedback is then inco-
rporated into the context, enabling iterative adaptation. Representative methods include Reflexion [40], which reflects on failures to improve agent planning; TextGrad [54], which optimizes prompts via gradient-like textual feedback; GEPA [4], which refines prompts iteratively based on execution traces and achieves strong performance, even surpassing reinforcement learning approaches in some settings; and Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], which constructs an external memory that accumulates strategies and -
lessons from past successes and failures during inference. These natural language feedback methods represent a major advance, offering flexible and interpretable signals for improving LLM systems beyond weight updates.
2.2 Limitations of Existing Context Adaptation Methods
The Brevity Bias. A recurring limitation of context adaptation methods is brevity bias: the tendency of optimization to collapse toward short, generic prompts. Gao et al. [16] document this effect in prompt optimization for test generation, where iterative methods repeatedly produced near-identical instructions (e.g., "Create unit tests to ensure methods behave as expected"), sacrificing diversity and omitting domainspecific detail. This convergence not only narrows the search space but also propa-
gates recurring errors across iterations, since optimized prompts often inherit the same faults as their seeds. More broadly, such bias undermines performance in domains that demand detailed, context-rich guidance—such as multi-step agents, program synthesis, or knowledge-intensive reasoning—where success hinges on accumulating rather than compressing task-specific insights.

Figure 2: Context Collapse. Monolithic rewriting of context by an LLM can collapse it into shorter, less informative summaries, leading to sharp performance drops.
Context Collapse. In a case study on the AppWorld benchmark [43], we observe a phenomenon we call context collapse, which arises when an LLM is tasked with fully rewriting the accumulated context at each adaptation step. As the context grows large, the model tends to compress it into much shorter, less informative summaries, causing a dramatic loss of information. For instance, at step 60 the context contained
3

 18,282 tokens and achieved an accuracy of 66.7, but at the very next step it collapsed to just 122 tokens, with accuracy dropping to 57.1—worse than the baseline accuracy of 63.7 without adaptation. While we highlight this through Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], the issue is not specific to that method; rather, it reflects a fundamental risk of end-to-end context rewriting with LLMs, where accumulated knowledge can be abruptly erased instead of preserved.
Figure 3: Example ACE-Generated Context on the AppWorld Benchmark (partially shown). ACE-generated contexts contain detailed, domain-specific insights along with tools and code that are readily usable, serving as a comprehensive playbook for LLM applications.
3 Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)
We present ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework for scalable and efficient context adaptation in both offline (e.g., system prompt optimization) and online (e.g., test-time memory adaptation) scenarios. Instead of condensing knowledge into terse summaries or static instructions, ACE treats contexts as evolving playbooks that continuously accumulate, refine, and organize strategies over time. Building on the agentic design of Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], ACE introduces a structured division o-
f labor across three roles (Figure 4): the Generator, which produces reasoning trajectories; the Reflector, which distills concrete insights from successes and errors; and the Curator, which integrates these insights into structured context updates. This mirrors how humans learn—experimenting, reflecting, and consolidating—while avoiding the bottleneck of overloading a single model with all responsibilities.
To address the limitations of prior methods discussed in §2.2—notably brevity bias and context collapse—ACE introduces three key innovations: (1) a dedicated Reflector that separates evaluation and insight extraction from curation, improving context quality and downstream performance (§4.5); (2) incremental delta updates (§3.1) that replace costly monolithic rewrites with localized edits, reducing both latency and compute cost (§4.6); and (3) a grow-and-refine mechanism (§3.2) that balances steady-
 context expansion with redundancy control.

Figure 4: The ACE Framework. Inspired by Dynamic Cheatsheet, ACE adopts an agentic architecture with three specialized components: a Generator, a Reflector, and a Curator.
As shown in Figure 4, the workflow begins with the Generator producing reasoning trajectories for new queries, which surface both effective strategies and recurring pitfalls. The Reflector critiques these traces to extract lessons, optionally refining them across multiple iterations. The Curator then synthesizes these lessons into compact delta entries, which are merged deterministically into the existing context by lightweight, non-LLM logic. Because updates are itemized and localized, multiple d-
eltas can be merged in parallel, enabling batched adaptation at scale. ACE further supports multi-epoch adaptation, where the same queries are revisited to progressively strengthen the context.
3.1 Incremental Delta Updates
A core design principle of ACE is to represent context as a collection of structured, itemized bullets, rather than a single monolithic prompt. The concept of a bullet is similar to the concept of a memory entry in LLM memory frameworks like Dynamic Cheatsheet [41] and A-MEM [48], but builds on top of that and consists of (1) metadata, including a unique identifier and counters tracking how often it was marked helpful or harmful; and (2) content, capturing a small unit such as a reusable strategy,-
 domain concept, or common failure mode. When solving new problems, the Generator highlights which bullets were useful or misleading, providing feedback that guides the Reflector in proposing corrective updates.
This itemized design enables three key properties: (1) localization, so only the relevant bullets are updated; (2) fine-grained retrieval, so the Generator can focus on the most pertinent knowledge; and (3) incremental adaptation, allowing efficient merging, pruning, and de-duplication during inference.
Rather than regenerating contexts in full, ACE incrementally produces compact delta contexts: small sets of candidate bullets distilled by the Reflector and integrated by the Curator. This avoids the computational cost and latency of full rewrites, while ensuring that past knowledge is preserved and new insights are steadily appended. As contexts grow, this approach provides the scalability needed for long-horizon or domain-intensive applications.
3.2 Grow-and-Refine
Beyond incremental growth, ACE ensures that contexts remain compact and relevant through periodic or lazy refinement. In grow-and-refine, bullets with new identifiers are appended, while existing bullets are updated in place (e.g., incrementing counters). A de-duplication step then prunes redundancy by comparing bullets via semantic embeddings. This refinement can be performed proactively (after each delta) or lazily (only when the context window is exceeded), depending on application requirements-
 for latency and accuracy.

 Together, incremental updates and grow-and-refine maintain contexts that expand adaptively, remain interpretable, and avoid the potential variance introduced by monolithic context rewriting.
4 Results
Our evaluation of ACE shows that:
• Enabling High-Performance, Self-Improving Agents. ACE enables agents to self-improve by dynamically refining their input context. It boosts accuracy on the AppWorld benchmark by up to 17.1% by learning to engineer better contexts from execution feedback alone, without needing ground-truth labels. This contextdriven improvement allows a smaller, open-source model to match the performance of the top-ranked proprietary agent on the leaderboard. (§4.3) • Large Gains on Domain-Specific Benchmarks. On-
 complex financial reasoning benchmarks, ACE delivers an average performance gain of 8.6% over strong baselines by constructing comprehensive playbooks with domain-specific concepts and insights. (§4.4) • Effective by Design. Ablation studies confirm our design choices are key to success, with components like the Reflector and multi-epoch refinement each contributing substantial performance gains. (§4.5) • Lower Cost and Adaptation Latency. ACE achieves these gains efficiently, reducing adaptation-
 latency by 86.9% on average, while requiring fewer rollouts and lower token dollar costs. (§4.6)
4.1 Tasks and Datasets
We evaluate ACE on two categories of LLM applications that benefit most from a comprehensive and evolving context: (1) agent benchmarks, which require multi-turn reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction, where agents can accumulate and reuse strategies across episodes and environments; and (2) domain-specific benchmarks, which demand mastery of specialized concepts and tactics, where we focus on financial analysis as a case study.
• LLM Agent: AppWorld [43] is a suite of autonomous agent tasks involving API understanding, code generation, and environment interaction. It provides a realistic execution environment with common applications and APIs (e.g., email, file system) and tasks of two difficulty levels (normal and challenge). A public leaderboard [5] tracks performance, where, at the time of submission, the best system achieved only 60.3% average accuracy, highlighting the benchmark’s difficulty and realism.
• Financial Analysis: FiNER [33] and Formula [44] test LLMs on financial reasoning tasks that rely on the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). FiNER requires labeling tokens in XBRL financial documents with one of 139 fine-grained entity types, a key step for financial information extraction in regulated domains. Formula focuses on extracting values from structured XBRL filings and performing computations to answer financial queries, i.e., numerical reasoning.
Evaluation Metrics. For AppWorld, we follow the official benchmark protocol and report Task Goal Completion (TGC) and Scenario Goal Completion (SGC) on both the test-normal and test-challenge splits. For FiNER and Formula, we follow the original setup and report accuracy, measured as the proportion of predicted answers that exactly match the ground truth.
All datasets follow the original train/validation/test splits. For offline context adaptation, methods are optimized on the training split and evaluated on the test split with pass@1 accuracy. For online context adaptation, methods are evaluated sequentially on the test split: for each sample, the model first predicts with the current context, then updates its context based on that sample. The same shuffled test split is used across all methods.
4.2 Baselines and Methods
Base LLM. The base model is evaluated directly on each benchmark without any context engineering, using the default prompts provided by dataset authors. For AppWorld, we follow the official ReAct [52]

 implementation released by the benchmark authors, and build all other baselines and methods on top of this framework.
In-Context Learning (ICL) [3]. ICL provides the model with task demonstrations in the input prompt (few-shot or many-shot). This allows the model to infer the task format and desired output without weight updates. We supply all training samples when they fit within the model’s context window; otherwise, we fill the window with as many demonstrations as possible.
MIPROv2 [36]. MIPROv2 is a popular prompt optimizer for LLM applications that works by jointly optimizing system instructions and in-context demonstrations via bayesian optimization. We use the official DSPy implementation [15], setting auto="heavy" to maximize optimization performance.
GEPA [4]. GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) is a sample-efficient prompt optimizer based on reflective prompt evolution. It collects execution traces (reasoning, tool calls, intermediate outputs) and applies naturallanguage reflection to diagnose errors, assign credit, and propose prompt updates. A genetic Pareto search maintains a frontier of high-performing prompts, mitigating local optima. Empirically, GEPA outperforms reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and prompt optimizers like MIPROv2, achievin-
g up to 10–20% higher accuracy with as much as 35× fewer rollouts. We use the official DSPy implementation [14], setting auto="heavy" to maximize optimization performance.
Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC) [41]. DC is a test-time learning approach that introduces an adaptive external memory of reusable strategies and code snippets. By continuously updating this memory with newly encountered inputs and outputs, DC enables models to accumulate knowledge and reuse it across tasks, often leading to substantial improvements over static prompting methods. A key advantage of DC is that it does not require ground-truth labels: the model can curate its own memory from its generations,-
 making the method highly flexible and broadly applicable. We use the official implementation released by the authors [42] and set it to use the cumulative mode (DC-CU).
ACE (ours). ACE optimizes LLM contexts for both offline and online adaptation through an agentic context engineering framework. To ensure fairness, we use the same LLM for the Generator, Reflector, and Curator (non-thinking mode of DeepSeek-V3.1 [13]), preventing knowledge transfer from a stronger Reflector or Curator to a weaker Generator. This isolates the benefit of context construction itself. We adopt a batch size of 1 (constructing a delta context from each sample). We set the maximum number-
 of Reflector refinement rounds and the maximum number of epochs in offline adaptation to 5.
4.3 Results on Agent Benchmark
Analysis. As shown in Table 1, ACE consistently improves over strong baselines on the AppWorld benchmark. In the offline setting, ReAct + ACE outperforms both ReAct + ICL and ReAct + GEPA by significant margins (12.3% and 11.9%, respectively), demonstrating that structured, evolving, and detailed contexts enable more effective agent learning than fixed demonstrations or single optimized instruction prompts. These gains extend to the online setting, where ACE continues to outperform prior adaptive -
methods such as Dynamic Cheatsheet by an average of 7.6%.
In the agent use case, ACE remains effective even without access to ground-truth labels during adaptation: ReAct + ACE achieves an average improvement of 14.8% over the ReAct baseline in this setting. This robustness arises because ACE leverages signals naturally available during execution (e.g., code execution success or failure) to guide the Reflector and Curator in forming structured lessons of successes and failures. Together, these results establish ACE as a strong and versatile framework for-
 building self-improving agents that adapt reliably both with and without labeled supervision.
Notably, on the latest AppWorld leaderboard (as of September 20, 2025; Figure 5), on average, ReAct + ACE (59.4%) matches the top-ranked IBM CUGA (60.3%), a production-level GPT-4.1–based agent [35], despite using the smaller open-source model DeepSeek-V3.1. With online adaptation, ReAct + ACE even

XBRL rules) that goes beyond fixed demonstrations or monolithic optimized prompts. In the online setting, ACE continues to exceed prior adaptive methods such as DC by an average of 6.2%, further confirming the benefit of agentic context engineering for accumulating reusable insights across specialized domains.
Moreover, we also observe that when ground-truth supervision or reliable execution signals are absent, both ACE and DC may degrade in performance. In such cases, the constructed context can be polluted by spurious or misleading signals, highlighting a potential limitation of inference-time adaptation without reliable feedback. This suggests that while ACE is robust under rich feedback (e.g., code execution results or formula correctness in agent tasks), its effectiveness depends on the availabilit-
y of signals that allow the Reflector and Curator to make sound judgments. We return to this limitation in Appendix B.
4.5 Ablation Study
Table 3 reports ablation studies on the AppWorld benchmark, analyzing how individual design choices of ACE contribute to effective context adaptation. We examine three factors: (1) the Reflector with iterative refinement, our addition to the agentic framework beyond Dynamic Cheatsheet, (2) multi-epoch adaptation, which refines contexts over training samples multiple times, and (3) offline warmup, which initializes the context through offline adaptation before online adaptation begins.
4.6 Cost and Speed Analysis
Due to its support for incremental, “delta" context updates and non-LLM-based context merging and deduplication, ACE demonstrates particular advantages in reducing the cost (in terms of the number of rollouts or the amount of dollar cost for token ingestion/generation) and latency of adaptation.
As examples, on the offline adaptation of AppWorld, ACE achieves 82.3% reduction in adaptation latency and 75.1% reduction in the number of rollouts as compared to GEPA (Table 4(a)). On the online adaptation
9

 of FiNER, ACE achieves 91.5% reduction in adaptation latency and 83.6% reduction in token dollar cost for token ingestion and generation as compared to DC (Table 4(b)).
5 Discussion
Longer Context ̸= Higher Serving Cost. Although ACE produces longer contexts than methods such as GEPA, this does not translate to linearly higher inference cost or GPU memory usage. Modern serving infrastructures are increasingly optimized for long-context workloads through techniques such as the reuse [17, 51], compression [30, 32], and offload [25] of KV cache. These mechanisms allow frequently reused context segments to be cached locally or remotely, avoiding repetitive and expensive prefill o-
perations. Ongoing advances in ML systems suggest that the amortized cost of handling long contexts will continue to decrease, making context-rich approaches like ACE increasingly practical in deployment.
Implications for Online and Continuous Learning. Online and continuous learning are key research directions in machine learning for addressing issues like distribution shifts [19, 24] and limited training data [21, 37, 60]. ACE offers a flexible and efficient alternative to conventional model fine-tuning, as adapting contexts is generally cheaper than updating model weights [9, 20, 26, 28]. Moreover, because contexts are human-interpretable, ACE enables selective unlearning [8, 10, 29]—whether due-
 to privacy or legal constraints [1, 2], or when outdated or incorrect information is identified by domain experts. These are promising directions for future work, where ACE could play a central role in advancing continuous and responsible learning.

 A Related Work on Agent Memory
A growing body of work explores how agents can accumulate experience from past trajectories and leverage external (often non-parametric) memory to guide future actions. AgentFly [59] presents an extensible framework where memory evolves continuously as agents solve tasks, enabling scalable reinforcement learning and long-horizon reasoning across diverse environments. AWM (Agent Workflow Memory) [46] induces reusable workflows—structured routines distilled from past trajectories—and selectively inj-
ects them into memory to improve efficiency and generalization in web navigation benchmarks. A-MEM [48] introduces a dynamically organized memory system inspired by the Zettelkasten method: each stored memory is annotated with structured attributes (e.g., tags, keywords, contextual descriptions) and automatically linked to relevant past entries, while existing entries are updated to integrate new knowledge, yielding adaptive and context-aware retrieval. Agentic Plan Caching [58] instead focuses on-
 cost efficiency by extracting reusable plan templates from agent trajectories and caching them for fast execution at test time.
Together, these works demonstrate the value of external memory for improving adaptability, efficiency, and generalization in LLM agents. Our work differs by tackling the broader challenge of context adaptation, which spans not only agent memory but also system prompts, factual evidence, and other inputs underpinning AI systems. We further highlight two fundamental limitations of existing adaptation methods—brevity bias and context collapse—and show that addressing them is essential for robustness,-
 reliability, and scalability beyond raw task performance. Accordingly, our evaluation considers not only accuracy but also cost, latency, and scalability.
B Limitations and Challenges
A potential limitation of ACE is its reliance on a reasonably strong Reflector: if the Reflector fails to extract meaningful insights from generated traces or outcomes, the constructed context may become noisy or even harmful. In domain-specific tasks where no model can extract useful insights, the resulting context will naturally lack them. This dependency is similar to Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], where the quality of adaptation hinges on the underlying model’s ability to curate memory. We also note-
 that not all applications require rich or detailed contexts. Tasks like HotPotQA [50] often benefit more from concise, high-level instructions (e.g., how to retrieve and synthesize evidence) than from long contexts. Similarly, games with fixed strategies such as Game of 24 [41] may only need a single reusable rule, rendering additional context redundant. Overall, ACE is most beneficial in settings that demand detailed domain knowledge, complex tool use, or environment-specific strategies that go -
beyond what is already embedded in model weights or simple system instructions.

 D Prompts
We release the language model prompts used in our agentic context engineering framework as well as the baselines to support research transparency and reproducibility.
I am your supervisor and you are a super intelligent AI Assistant whose job is to achieve my day-to-day tasks completely autonomously.
To do this, you will need to interact with app/s (e.g., spotify, venmo etc) using their associated APIs on my behalf. For this you will undertake a multi-stepconversationusing a python REPL environment. That is, you will write the python code and the environment will execute it and show you the result, based on which, you will write python code for the next step and so on, until you’ve achieved the goal. This environment will let you interact with app/s using their associated APIs on my behalf.
Here are three key APIs that you need to know to get more information
Each code execution will produce an output that you can use in subsequent calls. Using these APIs, you can now generate code, that I will execute, to solve the task.
Let’s start with the task
[3 shot example]
Key instructions:
1. Make sure to end code blocks with ``` followed by a newline().
2. Remember you can use the variables in your code in subsequent code blocks.
3. Remember that the email addresses, access tokens and variables (e.g. spotify_password) in the example above are not valid anymore.
4. You can use the “supervisor” app to get information about my accounts and use the “phone” app to get information about friends and family.
5. Always look at API specifications (using apis.api_docs.show_api_doc) before calling an API.
6. Write small chunks of code and only one chunk of code in every step. Make sure everything is working correctly before making any irreversible change.
7. Many APIs return items in “pages”. Make sure to run through all the pages by looping over page_index.
8. Once you have completed the task, make sure to call apis.supervisor.complete_task(). If the task asked for some information, return it as the answer argument, i.e. call apis.supervisor.complete_task(answer=<answer>). Many tasks do not require an answer, so in those cases, just call apis.supervisor.complete_task() i.e. do not pass any argument.
Using these APIs, generate code to solve the actual task:
My name is: {{ main_user.first_name }} {{ main_user.last_name }}. My personal email is {{ main_user.email }} and phone number is {{ main_user.phone_number }}.
Task: {{ input_str }}
# To get a list of apps that are available to you. print(apis.api_docs.show_app_descriptions())
# To get the list of apis under any app listed above, e.g. spotify print(apis.api_docs.show_api_descriptions(app_name='spotify'))
# To get the specification of a particular api, e.g. spotify app's login api print(apis.api_docs.show_api_doc(app_name='spotify', api_name='login'))

Domain-Specific Strategy for Bill Splitting Tasks: When splitting bills among roommates, remember to: - First identify roommates using phone app’s search_contacts with “roommate” relationship query - Access bill receipts in file system under “/home/[username]/bills/” directory structure - Calculate equal shares by dividing total amount by (number of roommates + 1) including yourself - Use Venmo’s create_payment_request API with roommates’ email addresses - Ensure payment requests are only sent to -
actual roommates (not coworkers or other contacts) - Verify that all roommates have the same home address in their contact information - Use the description “I paid for cable bill.” for payment requests
Domain-Specific Strategy for File Organization Tasks: When organizing files based on creation dates, remember to: - First login to the file system using credentials from supervisor - Use show_directory() to list files and show_file() to get file metadata including created_at - Create destination directories using create_directory() before moving files - Use move_file() to organize files while maintaining original filenames - Files created in specific months should be moved to corresponding destina-
tion directories (e.g., March → Rome, April → Santorini, others → Berlin)
Domain-Specific Strategy for Music Playlist Tasks: When creating playlists for specific durations, remember to: - Calculate total duration needed (e.g., 90 minutes = 5400 seconds) - Search for appropriate songs across different genres (workout, energetic, rock, pop, dance) - Use show_song() to get individual song durations - Add songs to playlist until total duration requirement is met - Use play_music() with playlist_id to start playback
Domain-Specific Strategy for File Compression Tasks: When compressing vacation photo directories, remember to: - Compress each vacation spot directory individually - Save compressed files in the specified destination path format (e.g., “~/photographs/vacations/.zip”) - Delete the original directories after successful compression - Verify that the compressed files are created in the correct location
Domain-Specific Strategy for Alarm Management Tasks: When modifying phone alarms, remember to: - Identify the specific alarm by its label (e.g., “Wake Up”) - Calculate new times accurately (convert HH:MM to minutes for arithmetic operations) - Disable all other enabled alarms except the one being modified - Preserve all other alarm settings while making changes
Domain-Specific Strategy for Message Management Tasks: When handling text/voice messages, remember to: - Use search functions to find specific messages by phone number or content - Handle pagination to ensure all relevant messages are processed Delete messages using their specific message IDs - Verify deletion by checking that no messages remain
Let’s start with the task:
# To get a list of apps that are available to you. print(apis.api_docs.show_app_descriptions())
# To get the list of apis under any app listed above, e.g. spotify print(apis.api_docs.show_api_descriptions(app_name='spotify'))
# To get the specification of a particular api, e.g. spotify app's login api print(apis.api_docs.show_api_doc(app_name='spotify', api_name='login'))

If the task asked for some information, return it as the answer argument, i.e. call apis.supervisor.complete_task(answer=<answer>). Many tasks do not require an answer, so in those cases, just call apis.supervisor.complete_task() i.e. do not pass any argument.
9. Treat the cheatsheet as a tool. Use only the parts that are relevant and applicable to your specific situation and task context, otherwise use your own judgement.
Using these APIs and cheatsheet, generate code to solve the actual task:
My name is: {{ main_user.first_name }} {{ main_user.last_name }}. My personal email is {{ main_user.email }} and phone number is {{ main_user.phone_number }}. Task: {{ input_str }}
# To get a list of apps that are available to you. print(apis.api_docs.show_app_descriptions())
# To get the list of apis under any app listed above, e.g. spotify print(apis.api_docs.show_api_descriptions(app_name='spotify'))
# To get the specification of a particular api, e.g. spotify app's login api print(apis.api_docs.show_api_doc(app_name='spotify', api_name='login'))

 You are an expert AppWorld coding agent and educator. Your job is to diagnose the current trajectory: identify what went wrong (or could be better), grounded in execution feedback, API usage, unit test report, and ground truth when applicable.
Instructions: - Carefully analyze the model’s reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong - Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap - Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies - Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future - Identify root causes: wrong source of truth, bad filters (timeframe/direction/identity), formatting issues, or-
 missing authentication and how to correct them. - Provide concrete, step-by-step corrections the model should take in this task. - Be specific about what the model should have done differently - You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that’s used by the generator to answer the question. - You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be [‘helpful’, ‘harmful’, ‘neutral’] (for the generator to generate the correct answer) - Explicitly curate -
from the environment feedback the output format/schema of APIs used when unclear or mismatched with expectations (e.g., apis.blah.show_contents() returns a list of content_ids (strings), not content objects)
Inputs:
Ground truth code (reference, known-correct):
GROUND_TRUTH_CODE_START
{{ground_truth_code}}
GROUND_TRUTH_CODE_END
Test report (unit tests result for the task after the generated code was run):
TEST_REPORT_START
{{unit_test_results}}
TEST_REPORT_END
ACE playbook (playbook that’s used by model for code generation):
PLAYBOOK_START
{{playbook}}
PLAYBOOK_END
Examples:
Example 1:
Ground Truth Code: [Code that uses apis.phone.search_contacts() to find roommates, then filters Venmo transactions]
Generated Code: [Code that tries to identify roommates by parsing Venmo transaction descriptions using keywords like “rent”, “utilities”]
Execution Error: AssertionError: Expected 1068.0 but got 79.0
Test Report: FAILED - Wrong total amount calculated due to incorrect roommate identification
Response:
{{
“reasoning”: “The generated code attempted to identify roommates by parsing Venmo transaction descriptions rather than using the authoritative Phone app contacts. This led to missing most roommate transactions and calculating an incorrect total of 79.0 instead of 1068.0.”,
“error_identification”: “The agent used unreliable heuristics (keyword matching in transaction descriptions) to identify roommates instead of the correct API (Phone contacts).”,
“root_cause_analysis”: “The agent misunderstood the data architecture - it assumed transaction descriptions contained reliable relationship information, when the Phone app is the authoritative source for contact relationships.”,
“correct_approach”: “First authenticate with Phone app, use apis.phone.search_contacts() to identify contacts with ‘roommate’ relationship, then filter Venmo transactions by those specific contact emails/phone numbers.”,
“key_insight”: “Always resolve identities from the correct source app - Phone app for relationships, never rely on transaction descriptions or other indirect heuristics which are unreliable.”
}}
Example 2:
Ground Truth Code: [Code that uses proper while True pagination loop to get all Spotify playlists]
Generated Code: [Code that uses for i in range(10) to paginate through playlists]
Execution Error: None (code ran successfully)
Test Report: FAILED - Expected 23 playlists but got 10 due to incomplete pagination
Response:
{{
“reasoning”: “The generated code used a fixed range loop (range(10)) for pagination instead of properly iterating until no more results are returned. This caused the agent to only collect the first 10 pages of playlists, missing 13 additional playlists that existed on later pages.”,
“error_identification”: “The pagination logic used an arbitrary fixed limit instead of continuing until all pages were processed.”,
“root_cause_analysis”: “The agent used a cautious approach with a fixed upper bound to avoid infinite loops, but this prevented complete data collection when the actual data exceeded the arbitrary limit.”,
“correct_approach”: “Use while True loop with proper break condition: continue calling the API with incrementing page_index until the API returns empty results or null, then break.”,
“key_insight”: “For pagination, always use while True loop instead of fixed range iterations to ensure complete data collection across all available pages.”
}}
Outputs: Your output should be a json object, which contains the following fields - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning? - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood? correct_approach: what should the model have done instead? - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?
Answer in this exact JSON format:

 You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.
Context: - The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. - The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth.
Instructions: - Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt - Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook - Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook - Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed - Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one - -
Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections - For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field - Be concise and specific each addition should be actionable - For coding tasks, explicitly curate from the reflections the output format/schema of APIs used when unclear or mismatched with expectations (e.g., apis.blah.show_contents() returns a list of content_ids (strings), not content objects)

Current Playbook: [Basic API usage guidelines]
Generated Attempt: [Code that failed because it used transaction descriptions to identify roommates instead of Phone contacts]
Reflections: “The agent failed because it tried to identify roommates by parsing Venmo transaction descriptions instead of using the Phone app’s contact relationships. This led to incorrect identification and wrong results.”
Response:
Example 2:
Task Context: “Count all playlists in Spotify”
Current Playbook: [Basic authentication and API calling guidelines]
Generated Attempt: [Code that used for i in range(10) loop and missed playlists on later pages]
Reflections: “The agent used a fixed range loop for pagination instead of properly iterating through all pages until no more results are returned. This caused incomplete data collection.”
