High-rate remote entanglement between photon and matter-based qubits is essential for distributed quantum information processing. A key technique to increase the modest entangling rates of existing long-distance quantum networking approaches is multiplexing. Here, we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed ion-photon interface via rapid transport of a chain of nine calcium ions across 74 μm within 86 μs. The non-classical nature of the multiplexed photons is verified by mea
suring the second-order correlation function with an average value of g(2)(0) = 0.060(13), indicating negligible crosstalk between the multiplexed modes. In addition, we characterize the motional degree-of-freedom of the ion crystal after transport and find that it is coherently excited to as much as n ̄α ≈ 110 for the center-of-mass mode. Our proof-of-principle implementation paves the way for large-scale quantum networking with trapped ions, but highlights some challenges that must be overcome.
Remote entanglement across distant quantum nodes [1, 2] may be used for long-distance quantum key distribution [3, 4], modular quantum computer architectures [5, 6], as well as quantum enhanced metrology and sensing [7–9]. Light-matter quantum interfaces are a fundamental building block for such applications, and allow for distributed entanglement between stationary matter qubits by using "flying" photons.
For practical purposes, these quantum interfaces need to be capable of establishing remote entanglement at high rates across a large-scale network of quantum nodes. However, in widely adopted probabilistic schemes based on heralded photon detection [10–12], it is infeasible to distribute entanglement at useful rates over a few kilometers, as the attempt rate is limited by the round-trip travel-time of photons in a single mode. For example, for a communication distance of 10 km, photon-travel time -
will be around 100 μs, meaning that the attempt cannot be higher than 10 kHz. In this scenario, even with use of a state-of-the-art photon-matter interface that can yield close to unity photon extraction efficiency [13], the matter-photon entanglement rate beyond tens of kilome
ters would be limited to sub 10 s−1 with total loss around 15 dB after considering the collective probability of generating and detecting telecom photons at each node, along with the optical fiber loss [14, 15].
A key solution to this challenge is multiplexing: to combine multiple signals into a single channel and therefore increase the attempt rate [16, 17]. Multiplexing has become a mature technology for ensemble-based quantum interfaces, both in atomic gases and rare-earth ion doped solid-state systems [18–21]. However, large-scale local quantum information processing is technically challenging in these platforms [22].
In contrast, single emitters, including trapped ions and neutral atoms, offer excellent local quantum information processing capability beside their natural interface with
light at convenient wavelengths for quantum frequency conversion (QFC) [23, 24], and the possibility of longlived storage of entanglement [25, 26]. On the other hand, implementing a multiplexed light-matter interface with these systems is technically challenging. Towards overcoming this problem, a few multiplexing schemes have already been proposed for ion and atom-based quantum processors [27–30]. The only reported experimental work, we are aware of, is the demonstration of multiplexing using a s-
tatic three-ion chain [15]. In view of the recent advances of the quantum CCD architecture [31–33], a complementary approach to multiplexing is the process of ion-transport through a specific spatial location with maximized photon coupling efficiency.
In this work, we demonstrate a temporal multiplexing scheme based on the transport of an ion-chain for improving the rate of ion-photon entanglement over long distances. In our experiments, we generate on-demand single photons by shuttling a nine-ion chain across the focus of a single-ion addressing beam. This scheme is expected to lead to a nearly nine-fold increase in attempt rate of the entanglement generation for quantum repeater nodes separated by >100 km. We verify the single-photon nature o-
f the photon trains by measuring a second-order time correlation of g(2)(0) = 0.060(13) without background subtraction. Furthermore, we address the problem of motional excitation during the transport, which is detrimental to local entangling operations [34] and in the case of using a cavity for stimulating the photons would lead to uncertainly in the coupling strength. [35]. Using a shuttling function designed to mitigate motional excitation, we find coherent excitation of  ̄nα ∼ 50 on the center--
of-mass (COM) mode during one round of ion chain transport. These results show that the proposed multiplexing scheme can be scaled up to higher rates provided that more optimal transport methods are applied.

FIG. 1. Schematics of multiplexed ion-photon interface. (a) A nine-ion chain is confined in an RF Paul trap. Controlling DC endcap voltages allows for ion transport. A beam of 397 nm and 866 nm light illuminating all ions is used for Doppler cooling. An objective collects the 397 nm single photons and guides them to a 50/50 beamsplitter, followed by a photomultiplier tube on each exit port for photon detection. An 866 nm beam is focused down to ≈ 6.0 μs waist to address individual ions. (b), (c) E-
xcitation scheme and pulse sequence for the 397 nm single-photon generation. First, a global 397 nm beam
prepares the ions to the 32D3/2 state. Then, the 866 nm addressing beam (resonance with 32D3/2 ↔ 42P1/2) is stroboscopically switched on during the transport to extract photons from the target ions.

providing an axial harmonic confinement. We typically trap a string of nine 40Ca+ ions in a linear configuration with the COM mode frequency of ωx,z/(2π) = × {1.15, 0.179} MHz and Lamb-Dicke (LD) parameters of the axial modes, ranging between 0.09 and 0.23 on the 42S1/2 ↔ 32D5/2 transition. Two global laser beams at 397 nm and 866 nm (not shown in the figure) evenly illuminate the entire ion chain for Doppler cooling and optical pumping, and a tightly focused addressing beam at 866 nm allows for r-
esonant excitation to extract the 397 nm single photons from individual ions. The generated single photons are collected by an objective with a numerical aperture of NA = 0.3 (collection efficiency Pc ≈ 2.5%) and directed to a 50/50 beam splitter (BS). At the exit port of BS, photons are detected by two photomultiplier tube (PMT)-based single-photon detectors (SPD), and their arrival times are recorded with a timetagger for subsequent analysis. We generate on-demand single-photons based on a backg-
round-free scheme, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) [36]. In this process, we first Doppler cool (detuning ∆ = −Γ/2) the ion chain for 200 μs, with the first 100 μs assisted by another beam −500 MHz detuned from the 42S1/2 ↔ 42P1/2 transition (not shown) to mitigate collision induced ion chain melting in the Paul trap [37]. Then we begin the photon generation sequences with optical pumping to the 32D3/2 state for 3 μs, followed by transport of the chain to position each ion in the tight focus of the 86-
6 nm addressing beam resonant with 32D3/2 ↔ 42P1/2 transition to generate 397 nm single

photons (see Fig. 1(c)).
In the ion-chain transport process, the endcap voltages are controlled by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) amplified by a custom-made, low-noise amplifier circuit with a gain of ten through low-pass filters and a vacuum feedthrough. The low-pass filters have cutoff frequencies of 1.9 MHz to allow fast transport of the ion chain close to the speed of the COM mode frequency. The programmed and the measured waveform show a negligible latency effect from the filters (Fig. 2(a)). The forward shutt-
ling function has eight steps, during each of which a different ion is placed in the focus of the addressing beam

for 1.7 μs with the beam turned on simultaneously. After completing this sequence, we move the entire ion chain back to the original position in 35 μs using the same function form in one step. The voltage ramping function on the two endcaps V1,2(t) is in the form of a sigmoid-like polynomial function such that the first and second order derivative at the beginning and the end of the transport vanish [38].

The details of voltage optimization and numerical simulation of motional heating can be found in [39]. We reconstruct the temporal profile of 397 nm photons during transport using the recorded arrival times of photons on the PMTs. Fig 2(b) shows the emission from individual ions (modes). Data is accumulated for 40 -
min, during which around 1.56 × 106 attempts were made to the whole string, corresponding to attempt rate 39.0 kHz, an average photon extraction efficiency of 0.21 % and single photons count rate of around 71 cps. Next, we perform a two-photon correlation experiment to test the non-classical characteristics of our multiplexed photon source [40]. The probability of two-photon correlation when detecting a correlation event on two detectors at different times is given by
ρc(τ ) = ρ1(τ )ρ2(τ + δT ), (2)
where ρ1(τ ) and ρ2(τ + δT ) are the probability of detecting a photon at t = τ and τ + δT on detector 1 and 2. Fig. 3(a) shows the normalized correlation counts as a function of the delay mode window. We choose a coincidence window of 300 ns in each mode and measure 8 coincident counts at zero delay in 4.8 hours, corresponding to g(2)(0) = 0.060(13). The residual correlation can be explained by excitation of neighboring ions, i.e., crosstalk of the addressing beam, which is separately characteriz-
ed to be 0.99 % using fluorescence of the nineion chain on the camera, corresponding to expected average ge(2x)p(0) = 0.049(8) (see Supplemental [39]). To further verify this hypothesis, we repeat the measurement with a single ion (Fig. 3(c)) and compare it to addressing only the fifth ion in a static nine-ion chain (Fig. 3(b)). The two experiments yield g(2)(0) = 0.010(6) and g(2)(0) = 0.062(17) with 6.0 and 4.8 hours of data accumulation, respectively. While the single ion g2 is limited by the d-
etector dark counts and ambient light, the measurement of the static 9-ion chain g2 is limited by the crosstalk of the addressing beam. The results indicate the major source of residual correlation is addressing crosstalk [39]. This

can be mitigated by coupling the single photons into a single-mode fiber or improving the optical quality of the excitation beam.
After characterizing the single-photon nature of the transport-multiplexing scheme, we characterize the motion of the ions introduced by shuttling. This is important as the quality of subsequent quantum operations on the ions or ion-photon entanglement will depend on the ions’ motional states. We further explore the system performance by measuring the motional heating from the ion transport. To do this, we first perform sideband cooling for all axial modes sequentially using the method similar to -
that in [41] and prepare the ion in the state |↓⟩ = |42S1/2, mJ = −1/2⟩. We compare the
|↓⟩ ↔ |↑⟩ = |32D1/2, mJ = −1/2⟩ carrier transition before and after transport with a global 729 nm beam along the axial direction to determine how the transport affects the ion-motion (Fig. 4). The carrier Rabi flopping is motional state sensitive, and the Hamiltonian has the form of [42, 43]

where Ω(i) is the Rabi frequency of the ith ion, am and a†m are the creation and annihilation operators on the mth mode, and ηi,m is the LD parameter of the ith ion and the mth mode. Considering the computational difficulty of including all motional modes in the simulation, we only consider the COM mode which we expect to be excited most because the electric fields, both from the transport and surface noise, are correlated over the whole ion string (see Supplemental [39]). Therefore, the average c-

where Pn is the occupation on the nth number state and encodes a convolution between a thermal and a coher
ent phonon distribution [44]. Ω(ni) is the Rabi frequency of the ith ion on the nth number state [45]. To verify the effectiveness of our approximation, we probe the sideband-cooled motional spectrum of the nine-ion chain before the tranport and verify that only the COM mode is not cooled to near the ground state [39], for which we find a cooling limit of  ̄nth = 4.0 ± 3.0. We also measure the electric-field noise induced heating and find a heating rate of 20 quanta / ms.(Fig. 4(a)), indicating th-
at the remaining thermal population is likely limited by the COM mode heating which scales as ion number N [46]. Fig. 4(b) shows the carrier Rabi flopping after ion transport twice as slow as in Fig. 2(a). From numerical simulations (blue line), we find that the data can be explained well by a coherent state  ̄nα = |α|2 ≈ 50 on the COM mode after the transport. Similarly, we perform the full-speed tranport and the carrier Rabi flopping matches with COM coherent state with  ̄nα ≈ 110 (Fig. 4(c)). A-
s shown in the Rabi flopping plots, there is mismatch between the experimental data and numerical simulation at full speed, which could be due to thermal and coherent occupation of other modes and will require additional investigation. For example, one can use an individual 729 nm addressing beam to probe the blue sideband transition of different modes [47]. The optimal fast transport of a long ion chain remains an open question and is beyond the scope of this work. However, we note that further o-
ptimization can be done by energy

self-neutral shuttling [31, 44], implementing closed-loop optimization of the shuttling function [48], etc.
To summarize, we have presented a multiplexed ionphoton interface by transporting a nine-ion chain with synchronized excitation in sub-hundred μs. The speed is restricted by the motional frequency and can be increased by an order of magnitude, for instance, using a 3D-printed ion trap [49] with radial frequency beyond 10 MHz. The 397 nm photon can be converted to the telecommunication band via a two-step QFC [24]. Once integrated with state preparation on 32D3/2 Zeeman sublevel and photon collecti-
on with a single mode fiber, we expect a faster photon extraction rate [50] and negligible ion crosstalk while achieving high fidelity ion-photon entanglement [51, 52]. Our system can also be combined with a miniature cavity [35] for much higher photon extraction efficiency without sacrificing the photon generation rate, while the ion’s positional spread caused by coherent excitation can be mitigated by aligning the cavity along the radial direction or further optimization of the shuttling functio-
n. These results stimulate the research of fast shuttling of a chain of tens of ions as a unit cell of logical qubit with heralded entanglement [28] and highrates entanglement of quantum processors across large distances.

I. CROSSTALK OF ADDRESSING LASER
In this section, we discuss the characterization of 866 nm
addressing light’s intensity crosstalk and corresponding cor
relation counts at zero delay time of our multiplexed photon
source. We conclude the residual correlation can be explained
by the crosstalk of the addressing beam.
A. Intensity crosstalk
Single ion addressing technique with 729 nm light has been
demonstrated for quantum information processing [S1]. In
this experiment, we use the objective that is optimized for
729 nm (S6ASS2241, Sill Optics) to focus the 866 nm light
to generate single photons from individual ions. To quantify
the intensity crosstalk of the nine-ion chain, we position each
ion at the center of the addressing beam, systematically vary
the beam’s power, and record the fluorescence of individual
ions using an Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera.
The correlation between photon scattering rate Rs and laser
power P for a two-level system is
Rs = γ · s
2(1 + s) , (S1)
∗ qiming.wu@berkeley.edu † hhaeffner@berkeley.edu
where s = k · P = P
Ps·(1+(2δ/γ)2) is the saturation parame
ter, Ps the saturation power, δ the laser detuning from atomic
resonance, and γ the decay rate of the excited state [S2]. With
397 nm laser power and detuning fixed, we use this function
to co-fit the fluorescence data of center ions and neighbor ions
as functions of 866 nm addressing laser power. Therefore, the
intensity crosstalk equals kn/k1, with k1 being the fitted pa
rameter for the center ions and kn being the fitted parameter
for a nth nearest-neighbor ion.
We characterize the crosstalk when the beam is centered on
each ion. Fig. S1 illustrate the ratio of laser intensity on the
non-addressed (neighbor) ions to the addressed (center) ion of
the nine-ion chain. The average intensity crosstalk between
the center and the nearest-neighbor ions is calculated to be
0.99 %.

B. Analysis of correlation counts at zero delay
With the 866 nm addressing beam crosstalk characteriza
tion, we estimate the expected residual correlation counts at
zero delay time, corresponding to g(2)(0) in the second-order
correlation function. We assume for each trial with 866 nm
addressing light, the probability of getting one photon from

the center ion is ρ0, the probability of getting one photon from
the two nearest neighbor ions is ρs1 and ρs2, and the combined
contribution of limited collection efficiency and loss along the
optical path is ρloss. For convenience, we use ρ ̃ = ρ·(1−ρloss).
Then, for non-zero delay time, if all other noise sources are ig
nored, we have correlation probability
ρc(n) = ( ρ ̃0 + ρ ̃s1 + ρ ̃s2
2 )2, n ̸= 0
in which there is a factor of 2 in the denominator coming from
the BS. For zero delay time, we have
ρc(0) = [2 ( ρ ̃0
2 ) · ( ρ ̃s1 + ρ ̃s2
2 ) + 2 ( ρ ̃s1
2 ) · ( ρ ̃s2
2 )].
Therefore in the limit of small crosstalk, we have
ge(x2p)(0) ≈ 2 · ρ ̃s1 + ρ ̃s2
ρ ̃0
+ g(2)
0 (0),
in which g(2)
0 (0) = 0.010(6) corresponds to the contribution
of other noise sources other than crosstalk, e.g., detector dark
counts and ambient light, that have been characterized by sin
gle ion correlation measurement (Fig. 3(c)). Therefore, we ex
pect ge(x2p)(0) = 0.050(13), which is the average g(2)(0) value
for nine ions as nine single photon sources. It agrees well
with our measurement result of g(2)(0) = 0.060(13) in the
multiplexed single-photon generation (Fig. 3(a)).
II. ION CHAIN TRANSPORT
In this section, we illustrate the voltage levels for ion po
sition control and numerical simulation of the shuttling pro
cess. Based on the simulation, the center of mass mode has
the dominant motional excitation during the ion transport.
A. Voltage levels setting for ions position control
Control of ion positions during fast shuttling is crucial since
misaligned ion positions may lead to insufficient photon ex
traction and increased crosstalk. To precisely align each ion
directly at the center of the addressing beam for every volt
age step, it is important to understand the ion-ion spacings in
the chain. Then, we need to make sure the change in voltage
levels matches the corresponding spacing between the ions.
In this experiment the two DC endcaps provide the axial con
finement. With average voltages of around 24.24 V on the
endcaps, the axial trap frequency is around 179 kHz. Combin
ing the Coulomb force and the harmonic potential, the relative
equilibrium positions of ions are shown in Fig. S2.
To facilitate the transport of ion chains from one end to the
other, we modulate the voltages by increasing voltage on one
endcap and decreasing voltage on another while the average
voltage remains unchanged. Fig. S3 shows the axial displace
ment of the trap potential’s center as a function of voltage
change on both endcaps, indicating a near linear relationship

between the trap center position and ∆V (t). Therefore, we
program the voltage level changes for each step by referring to
the ion-ion spacing, as shown in Fig. S2. Each voltage ramp is
following the function form with zero first and second-order
derivatives at the beginning and end, as Eqn. 1 in the main

differential equations (ODE) as

N ∑
j=1 j̸=i

(xi − xj)2 · sgn (xi − xj) (S2)
for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N . In the expression xi is the position of
each ion, ω0 the trap frequency along axial direction, k the
Coulomb’s constant, q the charge of electron, and m is the
mass of 40Ca+. To simulate this, we calculate the trajectory
of each ion by considering a time-dependent trap potential and
Coulomb interaction with all other ions. For initial states, the
equilibrium positions of each ion are solved using the Newton

method. The equilibrium positions of the nine-ion chain at
the beginning are shown in Fig. S2. Then, by simulating the
trap potential with finite element method, the temporal func
tion of trap frequency and trap center can be obtained. With
the programmed half-speed shuttling function, the positions
of all the ions during the transport are shown in Fig. S4. The
expected relative amplitudes of 9 motional modes along ax
ial direction at the end of the half-speed shuttling process are
shown in Fig. S5, showing only the COM mode is excited in
our simulation.

variation of the trap frequency and the total transport time, in
dicating that one reason for the high coherent excitation in our
measurement could be the inhomogeneity of the trap potential
during the transport. In the future, using a micro-fabricated
trap with multiple segmented DC electrodes can help to miti
gate this issue.
III. SIDEBAND COOLING FOR THE NINE-ION
CHAIN
In this section, we discuss the cooling scheme in this exper
iment and how thermal heating and coherent excitation influ
ence carrier Rabi flopping with 9 ions.
A. Cooling scheme
We use ∣∣42S1/2, mJ = +1/2〉 ↔ ∣∣32D1/2, mJ = −3/2〉
for optical pumping, ∣∣42S1/2, mJ = −1/2〉 ↔
∣∣32D1/2, mJ = −1/2〉 to probe the carrier transition,
and ∣∣42S1/2, mJ = −1/2〉 ↔ ∣∣32D1/2, mJ = −5/2〉 for
sideband cooling. Since the axial COM frequency is as
low as 179 kHz, the Doppler cooling limit is around 43
quanta, placing the ions beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime
before starting the sideband cooling. So we need to consider
the change of red sideband coupling strength at different

(S3)
in which s (> 0) is the order of red sideband [S4]. As shown
in Fig. S7, after Doppler cooling, the first-order sideband cool
ing may have inefficient coupling in a certain range of mo
tional states. Therefore, we first conduct sideband cooling on
the second-order red sideband of the three lowest frequency
modes and then the first-order red sideband for all the modes.
We also use additional cycles for sideband cooling on the
COM mode since we found this is the dominant mode for
thermal motions by scanning the motional spectrum. All these
sideband cooling cycles are performed relative to carrier tran
sition ∣∣42S1/2, mJ = −1/2〉 ↔ ∣∣32D1/2, mJ = −5/2〉. On
resonance, optical pumping cycles are inserted between and
performed at the end.
B. Spectrum scan
After the sideband cooling and optical pumping cycles, we
run a full spectrum scan covering the frequency range of all
the first-order motional modes along the axial direction. As
shown in Fig. S8, even though additional cycles are added for
COM mode, it dominates the motional excitation of the crystal
after sideband cooling, similar to what has been observed in
previous research [S5].
C. Carrier Rabi flop after sideband cooling
The carrier Rabi frequency is modulated according to mo
tional state occupation. In theory, all motional modes need to
be taken into consideration since they have different Lamb
Dicke parameters. However, in this experiment, both spec
trum scan and shuttling simulation show COM mode domi
nating the motional excitation. Therefore, we only consider

the COM mode for fitting carrier Rabi flops to reduce compu
tational complexity. The carrier Rabi frequency is [S6]
Ωnn = Ω e−|α|2/2Ln
(|α|2) , (S4)
in which α = iη ̃eiνt, ν is the trap frequency along the axial
direction, η ̃ is the effective Lamb-Dicke parameter, which for
the COM mode η ̃ = η/√N ≈ 0.077 with N being the num
ber of ions. So the dependence of carrier Rabi frequency on
the Lamb-Dicke parameter is

(S5)
Here, we expand the carrier Rabi frequency to the 6th order
because of the low trap frequency and high motional heating
so that the ions are out of the Lamb-Dicke regime.
While noise sources like surface noise and technical noise
will lead to a thermal state, fast shuttling causes coherent ex
citation. Fig. S9 shows that for coherent excitation, motional
states will distribute around the  ̄nα = |α|2 number state, while

thermal heating leads to a Boltzmann distribution of the num
ber states. In the presence of both mechanisms, The phonon probability follows a convolution of coherent and thermal dis
tribution, which has a much wider distribution over different
number states [S7, S8].
