# Mobile Onboarding Skill

Produce a three-screen mobile onboarding flow on a single HTML page.

## Workflow

1. Read DESIGN.md.
2. Identify the app + audience.
3. Layout: three phone frames side by side. Each phone:
   - Status bar (time, battery, signal).
   - Hero artwork or icon.
   - Headline + supporting paragraph.
   - 3-dot pagination.
   - Primary CTA (full-width pill button).
   - "Skip" or alt action top-right.
4. Last phone is the sign-in / continue-with options screen.
5. Strong typography, gentle gradients, accessible contrast.
