Abstract
Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity,
and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In
recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai,
LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean
dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of
open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation
methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance compar
ison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose
OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality
global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables
across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ
observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global
ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline
models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives.
OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently
available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model de
velopment, evaluation, and comparison. The dataset and code are publicly available at:
https://github.com/Ocean-Intelligent-Forecasting/OceanForecastBench.
Plain Language Summary
Ocean forecasts help us understand ocean currents, temperature, salinity and climate
impacts days ahead. Recent advances in AI-based models, such as XiHe and WenHai,
have shown great potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of ocean predictions.
However, the lack of a standardized benchmark for training and evaluating these models
poses a major barrier to fair comparison and reproducibility. Researchers currently rely
on disparate datasets and evaluation methods, which hinders scientific progress and model
development. To address this, we constructed OceanForecastBench, a comprehensive and
open-source benchmark that provides: (1) High-quality training data over 28 years of global
ocean reanalysis (temperature, currents, salinity etc.) at different depths. (2) Reliable eval
uation data which includes millions of real-world satellite and sensor observations to evaluate
model accuracy. (3) Standardized evaluation of 6 baseline models across key performance,
enabling clear comparisons.

1 Introduction
Global ocean forecasting is fundamentally important for supporting ocean activities,
such as ensuring the safety of maritime navigation, improving climate predictions, and
enhancing the management of marine resources (Meehl et al., 2021; Payne et al., 2022).
Conventional physics-driven methods achieve ocean forecasting by solving physical partial
differential equations (PDEs) using numerical simulations. However, the chaotic nature
of ocean makes solving PDEs highly complex and time-consuming. Consequently, these
methods often demand substantial computational resources and time.
Artificial Intelligence for Earth (AI4Earth) is revolutionizing ocean forecasting by en
abling the data-driven discovery of complex oceanographic patterns. Recent advancements
in AI have demonstrated significant potential for ocean forecasting (K. Chen et al., 2023;
L. Chen et al., 2023; Chae et al., 2024; K. Chen et al., 2024). Data-driven AI ocean forecast
ing models, such as XiHe (X. Wang et al., 2024), WenHai (Cui et al., 2025), LangYa (Yang
et al., 2024), and AI-GOMS (Xiong et al., 2023) achieve faster speeds, more accurate fore
casts, longer-term forecasting capability, and lower computational costs (Choudhury et al.,
2024). However, progress in this field still remains limited, with only a few studies. The
main reason is the absence of a public benchmark that enables fair algorithm compari
son and improves research reproducibility, which creates professional barriers within the
field (Kaltenborn et al., 2023; Dueben et al., 2022). Benchmarks are crucial for facilitat
ing algorithm comparison and model optimization, as demonstrated by ImageNet (Deng et
al., 2009), WeatherBench (Rasp et al., 2020a), and GLUE (A. Wang, 2018). Therefore,
establishing an open-source, unified benchmark for data-driven global ocean forecasting is
essential to propel progress in this domain.
However, creating such a benchmark for ocean forecasting involves several significant
challenges: (1) Requirement for expert knowledge in ocean forecasting-specific
benchmark. Developing a benchmark involves defining tasks, providing standardized
datasets, and evaluating models. Domain-specific knowledge is crucial to identify key vari
ables and avoid task flaws. Ocean forecasting integrates data from multiple sources, so
expert knowledge is needed for proper data processing and standardization. Additionally,
using only the reanalysis data for model evaluation may introduce the risk of bias and re
duced accuracy. Observations are often used to assess model performance, highlighting the
need for an observation-based evaluation pipeline. (2) Complexity of processing multi
–3

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
source data when constructing benchmark datasets. Deep learning models require
large datasets. Ocean forecasting relies on various data types (e.g., reanalysis, in-situ obser
vations, and satellite observations) for accuracy. Global reanalysis data is ideal for training,
offering consistency and comprehensive spatial coverage. Discrete observations, which record
the ocean’s true state, are suitable for model evaluation but come with challenges like incon
sistent quality (e.g., noise interference) and format. Integrating these data sources requires
careful selection and processing. (3) High time and computational resource demand
in baseline acquisition. Identifying appropriate baseline models is challenging, as few
AI models exist for ocean forecasting. Adapting models from other fields requires addi
tional efforts. Training models, especially deep learning ones, is computationally intensive.
For instance, training a single SwinTransformer variant on an 8-GPU cluster takes around
30 hours, and hyperparameter optimization further increases this burden. Additionally,
comparing results is time-consuming and requires expertise in oceanography.
This paper proposes a benchmark dataset for data-driven global ocean forecasting.
The task of the benchmark is to forecast key ocean variables, such as sea level anomaly
(SLA), sea surface temperature (SST), zonal and meridional components of currents (Uo
and Vo), temperature, and salinity. Specifically, for the training dataset, we primar
ily use GLORYS12 (Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis) (Jean-Michel et al., 2021), one of
the best products currently available. To account for the influence of sea surface environ
mental factors, we also integrate sea surface wind from ERA5 (Fifth Generation Global
Atmospheric Reanalysis) (Bell et al., 2021) and SST data from OSTIA (Operational Sea
Surface Temperature and Ice Analysis) (S. Good et al., 2020) into the training dataset.
The training dataset has been standardized to a uniform spatial and temporal resolution to
ensure usability, derived from over 13TB of raw data. For the evaluation dataset, we
utilize a range of observations (such as satellite remote sensing, in-situ observations, etc.)
as the ground truth for evaluating model performance. Specifically, we select the quality
controlled subsurface ocean temperature and salinity data from EN4 data (S. A. Good et
al., 2013; Gouretski & Reseghetti, 2010), 6-hour interpolated SST and currents data from
Global Drifter Program (GDP) (Lumpkin & Centurioni, 2019), and SLA data from Global
Ocean L3 Significant Wave Height From Reprocessed Satellite Measurements provided by
Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS L3). The evaluation dataset
covers approximately 100 million observation locations in the global ocean. A standard
ized evaluation pipeline is provided to align forecast data with discrete observations and

calculate evaluation metrics. For the baseline models, we conduct a detailed evaluation
of 6 representative models, including the operational numerical forecasting systems, and
the advanced deep learning models. A detailed analysis of the evaluation results highlights
the strengths and weaknesses of various baseline models, offering critical insights for fu
ture improvements. OceanForecastBench standardizes both model training and evaluation
processes, significantly simplifying data processing workflows. This benchmark facilitates
participation from scholars across diverse fields in ocean forecasting.
2 The OceanForecastBench Dataset
Figure 1 presents the schematic of the OceanForecastBench data collection and process
ing pipeline. The OceanForecastBench dataset covers a wide range of ocean variables above
643.57m, including temperature, salinity, and currents, providing comprehensive data for
ocean forecasting. It also integrates multi-source data, including reanalysis, satellite remote
sensing, buoy observations, and drifter observations. The detailed information about the
datasets included in OceanForecastBench is as shown in Table 1.
2.1 Training Dataset
GLORYS12 reanalysis is a high-quality, long-time ocean variables data provided by
CMEMS. GLORYS12 offers continuous estimates of the global ocean from 1993 to 2021, with
Figure 1: Schematic of the OceanForecastBench data collection and processing pipeline.

a horizontal resolution of 0.083° (approximately 8 kilometers at the equator). The vertical
structure contains 50 vertical layers extending from the sea surface to a depth of 5,000
meters, fully depicting the vertical structure of the ocean. GLORYS12 has been integrated
into the OceanForecastBench training dataset to provide globally scaled data for ocean
temperature, salinity, and currents, which are fundamental and essential ocean variables.
Mean dynamic topography (MDT) is also provided to facilitate the conversion of sea surface
height (SSH) and SLA. The total size of the GLORYS12 data used in OceanForecastBench
is approximately 13TB.
ERA5 is a global meteorological reanalysis data provided by the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ERA5 offers high-resolution sea surface wind
data (0.25◦ × 0.25◦) with a temporal resolution of once per six hours. Sea surface wind data
is a primary external force driving ocean circulation. So ERA5 has been integrated into the
training dataset to enable models to more accurately describe the impact of sea surface wind
and predict currents velocity. The total size of ERA5 data used is approximately 170GB.
OSTIA is a high-resolution, global-scale data product developed to provide accurate
and timely information on SST and sea ice concentration. OSTIA integrates satellite ob
servations from multiple sensors and numerical model forecasts to produce daily analyses

at a spatial resolution of approximately 1/20° (6 km). SST is a crucial indicator of the en
ergy exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. OSTIA has been integrated into the
training dataset to allow models to better simulate physical processes in the ocean surface
layer. The total size of the OSTIA data used is approximately 160GB.
2.2 Evaluation Dataset
EN4 observation is a high-quality controlled data of global ocean temperature and
salinity, covering the time range from 1900 to the 2025. The data primarily originates from
the global Argo buoy network, which consists of about 3,000 profiling buoys. These data
undergo a rigorous quality control process, including outlier detection, consistency checks,
and comparison with historical data, to ensure their accuracy and reliability. EN4 has been
integrated into the evaluation dataset for comparing the performance of ocean temperature
and salinity forecasts.
GDP observation is based on data from ocean surface drifters, which have undergone
rigorous quality control and interpolation at 6-hour intervals to provide a continuous record
of SST and currents. With high temporal resolution and global coverage, the GDP data
serves as ground truth for evaluating model predictive capabilities of SST and currents
velocity. GDP data has been integrated into the evaluation dataset for comparing the
performance of SST and currents forecasts.
CMEMS L3 provides a high-precision, long-time series of SLA remote sensing data.
It provides a long-term, high-resolution sea level anomaly (SLA) record since 1993 with
a sampling rate of 1 Hz (approximately 7 km resolution). The data has been accurately
corrected for the atmosphere and considers the effects of ocean tides. CMEMS L3 has been
integrated into the evaluation dataset for comparing the performance of SLA forecasts. The
total evaluation dataset data size is 57GB.
2.3 Data Processing
This benchmark provides a standardized data processing workflow that extracts spec
ified data from the original files according to task requirements, processes the data, and
outputs high-dimensional arrays for model training. Figure 1c illustrates the flow of data
processing.

The training data was collected from three sources (with different variables and resolu
tions) necessitating standardization to a uniform resolution. Since the original GLORYS12
data was substantial, containing daily 0.083° gridded data with 50 vertical levels from 1993
to 2020, the entire data size amounted to approximately 13TB. Considering the dataset’s
volume, GPU memory limitations, and available computing resources of most researchers, it
was necessary to downsample both the spatial resolutions and the number of vertical levels
to reduce the hardware demands (Rasp et al., 2020b). However, excessive downsampling
can result in significant information loss and the introduction of errors, which could affect
model prediction accuracy (Bremnes et al., 2024). After careful analysis and experiments, a
spatial resolution of 1.40625° and 23 vertical levels were chosen as a balanced trade-off be
tween resource limitations and the preservation of data fidelity. The chosen input variables
and vertical levels are as described in Table 2.
Standardize. The Climate Data Operators were used to regrid the three data sources
to a uniform resolution of 1.40625° over the same latitude and longitude range of 80◦S−90◦N
and 180◦W − 180◦E, resulting in a grid size of 121 × 256. Specially ERA5 is available at 4
time points each day: 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, and 18:00. Data from these four points is averaged
to align the temporal resolution.

Mask. The proportion of ocean and land on earth is 70.8% and 29.2% respectively.
So we use an ocean-land mask file extracted from GLORYS12 to distinguish between ocean
and land areas. All land positions are filled with zero values before inputting into the model.
Aggregate. The three data sources are combined according to the specified variable
order to produce a standardized, deep learning-ready data format. The single-layer vari
ables of SLA, 10m wind field, SST, and multi-layer temperature, salinity, and currents are
combined into a multidimensional grid array.
Train-Validation Split. The dataset is divided into training and validation datasets.
(a) The data from 1993 to 2017 is used to train the deep learning model, and (b) the data
from 2018 to 2020 is used as a validation set to validate the model performance during the
model training phase.
2.4 Evaluation Pipeline
Figure 1e illustrates the steps involved in calculating the metrics. In this work, we
have adopted a standardized data processing workflow for tensor-type data output by deep
learning models to ensure data consistency and accessibility. Specifically, through a data
processing script, the high-dimensional data in the array is split and extracted into multiple
independent files, each of which stores a specific ocean variable.
A core step in model performance evaluation is accurately aligning the grid forecasts
generated by the deep learning model with discrete observations in both the time and spatial
dimensions. The evaluation pipeline rigorously filters daily observations based on quality
identifiers to identify data points available for evaluation.
3 Problem Definition
Global ocean forecasting predicts ocean variables supporting decision-making in ocean
related activities. Within the OceanForecastBench framework, deep learning models are
used to forecast global ocean states for the next 1 to k days.
Mathematically, the ocean forecasting task is a multivariate input-output mapping
regression problem. The input data is represented as a three-dimensional tensor Xt ∈
RCin×H×W , where t denotes the current time step, Cin = 96 indicates the total number
of input ocean variables: 4 sea surface variables, and 4 ocean variables with 23 layers (see
–9

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
Table 2). H = 121 and W = 256 represent the number of grid points in the latitude
and longitude directions, respectively. The forecasting models aim to produce k -step-ahead
predictions Xˆ t+1:t+k = (Xˆ t+1, ..., Xˆ t+k), where Xˆ t+∆t ∈ RCout×H×W , ∆t = 1, .., k. Here,
Cout = 94 indicates that the output variables excluding the zonal and meridional wind
components used as the atmospheric forcing.
To evaluate the models, the forecast results need to be mapped from the forecast space
Yˆfct(t, pos) to the observation space Yˆobs(t, pos). The mapping operator M interpolates the
forecast data from a regular grid to the discrete observation locations:
M : Yˆfct(t, pos) → Yˆobs(t, pos) (1)
where pos = [Longitude, Latitude]⊤ ∈ R2, t = [Time] ∈ R+, ”→” indicates time resolution
alignment and spatial position alignment.
The evaluation metrics are then computed as:
Metrics = Eval(Yˆobs(t, pos), Yobs(t, pos)) (2)
where Eval denotes a series of operations used to calculate the metrics (see Section 4.2),
Yobs(t, pos) represents the observations from the evaluation dataset.
4 Experiments
We conducted extensive experiments using the OceanForecastBench dataset to evaluate
and compare the performance of various baseline models. The forecasting lead times are set
from 1 to 10 days. We use the Operational Mercator global ocean analysis from 2022 to 2023
as the initial conditions for the model forecast. Leveraging evaluation data from 2022 to
2023, we performed a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the experimental results from
multiple perspectives. These experiments were implemented using the PyTorch framework
and performed on 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
4.1 Benchmark Models
OceanForecastBench selected and evaluated baseline models from numerical methods
and deep learning methods:
The numerical forecast model chosen for this study is the French Physical System
(PSY4), which is recognized as one of the most advanced operational forecasting systems.
–10

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
PSY4 baseline is obtained by downsampling the high-resolution operational forecasts which
is obtained from https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00016. The deep learning-based forecast
models, including ResNet, SwinTransformer, ClimaX, and FourCastNet, are trained from
scratch using the training dataset. Details of their hyperparameters are provided in Table
3. The pre-trained forecast model XiHe are downloaded from https://github.com/Ocean
-Intelligent-Forecasting/XiHe-GlobalOceanForecasting.
PSY4 is a 0.083° global operational forecast system developed by Mercator Ocean
International. It is based on traditional numerical forecasting methods, that achieve fore
casting by solving the partial differential equations of the physical models using supercom
puters (Lellouche et al., 2018). To maintain consistency with other baseline models, the
resolution of PSY4’s forecasts was downsampled from 0.083° to 1.40625° during evaluation.
ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep neural network architecture that introduces
residual connections to facilitate the training of very deep models. By allowing informa
tion to bypass certain layers via skip connections, ResNet enables the network to learn
residual functions rather than direct mappings. This design mitigates vanishing gradient
issues and reduces performance degradation, thereby improving training stability in deep
architectures (He et al., 2016).
SwinTransformer is a visual model utilizing shifted-window self-attention to improve
for computational efficiency. Its hierarchical structure progressively merges patches for
multi-resolution feature maps, enabling multi-resolution feature extraction for both local
and global information, making it ideal for high-resolution tasks (Liu et al., 2021).
ClimaX is a flexible and generalizable pretrained deep learning model for a wide range
of climate and weather-related tasks. It employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture
to process spatiotemporal climate data and supports multidimensional tensor-to-tensor con
versions (Nguyen et al., 2023). Pretrained on global climate datasets using a self-supervised
learning objective, ClimaX can be fine-tuned for various downstream weather tasks.
FourCastNet is a data-driven weather forecasting model based on ViT and Adaptive
Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO). By replacing traditional numerical solvers with a learned
operator, it enables rapid prediction of the evolution of global atmospheric variables. Trained
on decades of reanalysis data, FourCastNet achieves competitive accuracy with traditional
numerical weather forecasting models while offering orders-of-magnitude faster inference,
–11

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
making it highly suitable for real-time and large-scale forecasting applications (Kurth et al.,
2023).
XiHe is a hierarchical transformer-based global ocean forecasting model. It introduces
two specialized components: the land-ocean masking mechanism that focuses on global
ocean circulation exclusively, and the ocean-specific block designed for effectively capturing
both local information and global teleconnections in the ocean. The pre-trained XiHe pro
duces forecasts at 0.083° resolution. Similar to PSY4, its resolution was also downsampled
during evaluation (X. Wang et al., 2024).

4.2 Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metrics are calculated individually for each ocean variable of the fore
cast. Four metrics are employed: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Anomaly Cor
relation Coefficient (ACC), and Climatology Skill Score (CSS). For the evaluation at time t,
let F t

In addition to the above commonly used metrics, the OceanForecastBench also utilizes the
CSS metric (Ryan et al., 2015). CSS quantifies the relative improvement of a forecast system
compared to the long-term climatological average. A positive CSS value indicates that the
forecast system outperforms the climate average. In contrast, a negative CSS means the
forecast system underperforms relative to the climate average. CSS is computed using the
formula:
CSS = 1 − RMSEForecast

4.3 Overall Forecasting Performance
Figure 2 presents an assessment of the model’s ability to provide forecasts of six key
ocean variables over lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days. The models were evaluated based
on observations from 2022 to 2023. For each lead time, the RMSE, Bias, ACC, and CSS were
averaged globally from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2023. PSY4, an internationally
recognized advanced global ocean numerical forecasting system, and XiHe, an impactful
data-driven eddy-resolving large model, are both constructed using high-resolution (0.083°)
data. To enable unified evaluation based on OceanForecastBench, this study follows the
international Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) standard procedure (Griffies
et al., 2016; Orr et al., 2017), in which raw forecast outputs of PSY4 and XiHe are spatially
downsampled to a standardized resolution of OceanForecastBench (1.40625°).
As illustrated in Figure 2, the RMSE values for all models generally increase with lead
time, indicating a degradation in prediction accuracy as the forecast horizon extends. The
ACC and CSS metrics similarly exhibit a downward trend, further reinforcing this obser
vation. Notably, the CSS valuess remain positive for all models even at longer lead times,
indicating that the models retain some predictive skill beyond climatological predictions.

of the temperature, salinity, SST, SLA, Uo and Vo for various baselines, over a forecast
period ranging from 1 to 10 days. RMSE, ACC, and CSS are computed using observations
provided by OceanForecastBench.
–14

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
Another key observation is that PSY4 performs well at short lead times, but its forecast
errors grow significantly as lead time increases. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the
RMSE of the SLA forecast at a 1-day lead time reveals a significant difference for PSY4
compared to other baseline models. However, between the 1-day and 6-day lead times, the
RMSE of PSY4 gradually converges with those of the other models, and by the 7-day lead
time, PSY4’s RMSE surpasses that of XiHe. This is likely due to the model’s use of a
time-stepping mechanism to progressively advance the forecast. At each step, the model
computes the next state based on the current state, leading to the gradual accumulation
of errors (Khaki & Awange, 2021). In contrast, the deep learning models in this study are
one-step prediction strategy, directly learning the mapping from input to output data. This
reduces the propagation and compounding of errors during forecasting (Tang et al., 2025).
For temperature and salinity prediction, the RMSE for the XiHe remains relatively
low compared to other models, indicating its superior performance in forecasting subsurface
ocean variables. In the case of SST prediction, the PSY4 demonstrates superior perfor
mance, maintaining lower RMSE, higher ACC and CSS values compared to other models,
especially at longer lead times. The results can be attributed to its foundation in physi
cal equations, which describe the evolution of SST. Compared to ocean temperatures, the
controlled processes of SST are relatively simpler, as they are primarily influenced by heat
exchange with the atmosphere (C. Wang et al., 2025). Therefore, the numerical model
structure and parameterization processes of SST are relatively easier to fit and optimize.
For SLA prediction, the PSY4 shows the best performance before the 6-day forecast lead
time. However, beyond seven days, XiHe outperforms PSY4, as evidenced by a more rapid
increase in PSY4’s SLA forecast RMSE relative to the other deep learning models. The
evaluation of currents velocity is performed by vertically interpolating the model forecasts
to match the observed depth. As shown in the Figure 2, all deep learning models outperform
the numerical model in long lead time currents velocity forecast. While the numerical model
shows the steepest increase in RMSE with increasing lead time, indicating its relatively poor
performance at longer lead times. Furthermore, we also observed that during the 1-10 day
forecast period, the ACC of velocity forecasts is generally below 0.6, which is typically con
sidered unreliable. This indicates that the reliability of various models in currents velocity

4.4 Forecasting Performance in Various Aspects
Daily forecasting performance. The performance of temperature forecasts was
assessed using three key metrics: RMSE, Bias, and ACC across lead times of 1 to 10 days.
Figure 3 shows the evaluation results of models by date. Figure 3a presents the RMSE and
Bias distributions for all models across lead times. As lead time increases, RMSE values
for all models exhibit a consistent upward trend, reflecting the inherent challenges of long
lead time forecasting. Notably, XiHe demonstrate lower RMSE values compared to other
baselines, particularly at longer lead times (e.g., 10-day forecasts). Figure 3c illustrates the
ACC values for all models across lead times. As the forecast lead time increases, the ACC

value distribution of the XiHe is more stable compared to other baseline models, highlighting
its ability to maintain forecast accuracy over extended periods of temperature forecasting.
As shown in Figure 3d, the ACC metric fluctuates markedly, with periods of high correlation
(ACC > 0.75) interspersed with phases of low correlation (ACC < 0.65). These variations
may be attributed to the dynamic nature of temperature anomalies.
The performance of various models in predicting salinity are summarized in the Fig
ure 4. The RMSE of salinity forecasts showed a slow increasing trend with increasing lead
time, indicating that the models showed high stability in forecasting salinity. This may be
attributed to the generally slow changes in ocean salinity. Additionally, we observe that in

the salinity forecast, there are instances where a high RMSE is accompanied by a high ACC,
as well as cases where a low RMSE is associated with a low ACC. This is because in the
case of an overall high or low salinity field, the spatial distribution of the forecast matches
well with the observation, and the model spatial structure anomalies are highly correlated
with the observation, but there is an overall systematic bias in the absolute values, resulting
in a high RMSE while the ACC is still very high. The overall deviation of the forecast field
is very small (mean value, amplitude, etc. are consistent with observations, and the RMSE
is small), but the details of the spatial variations (anomaly distributions) are inconsistent

with observations, such as the location of the high- and low-value regions is reversed or the
phase is reversed, resulting in a small RMSE but also a small ACC.
Figure 5a illustrates the RMSE/Bias of SST forecasts as functions of lead time. Across
all lead times, the RMSE values of all models generally increase with longer lead times,
indicating the inherent challenge of maintaining forecast accuracy as the lead time extends.
The box plots reveal that models like PSY4 and XiHe exhibit relatively lower RMSE values
in all lead time forecasts, suggesting their superior performance and consistency in SST
forecasts. As shown in Figure 5c, the SwinTransformer and FourcastNet models exhibit
relatively lower ACC values across the lead time, with their box plots positioned lower and

showing larger variations, indicating poorer forecast performance compared to the other
models. From the results of Figure 5b and Figure 5d, we can observe that after 2023, the
RMSE and Bias curves begin to overlap as the number of available GDP buoys decreases.
This overlap signifies significant fluctuations in both metrics, indicating uncertainty in the
evaluation results. As a result, the model’s actual forecast performance becomes indis
tinguishable. Furthermore, after October 2023, due to a significant reduction in available
observational data, the ACC curve exhibited severe fluctuations and showed a negative cor
relation trend. Therefore, to ensure that the available observations are sufficient to robustly
assess the model performance, the overall performance evaluation of SST was conducted

using data from only the year 2022. This highlights the critical role that the number of
in-situ observations plays in effectively assessing the performance of forecasts.
Figure 6b presents the RMSE/Bias of 10-day SLA forecasts across different dates. The
RMSE values of all baselines remain relatively stable, but there are noticeable spikes and
drops at specific dates, which might be associated with changing oceanic and atmospheric
conditions or variations in the quality and quantity of input data. From the forecast results of
SLA in Figure 6a, we observed that all models exhibit a positive bias, indicating a consistent
tendency to underestimate SLA values. As shown in Figure 6c, the ACC values of all models
–21

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
generally decrease as the lead time increases, reflecting the diminishing correlation between
forecasted and observed SLA over longer prediction periods.
The analysis of Uo and Vo forecast results, as depicted in Figure 7 and 8, reveals
significant insights into the performance of various models across different lead times. It
can be observed that the RMSE values are distributed within a relatively narrow range,
but the ACC values for the velocity forecasts are all below 0.5, with numerous outliers
present in all three metrics. This indicates that the performance of all models in currents
velocity forecasts is unreliable. A possible reason is the limited and poor-quality velocity
data, which increases the difficulty of accurate velocity forecasting. Other studies indicate
that only 3.8% of the mid-depth ocean (including parts of the equatorial Pacific and the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current) can be considered accurately modeled, while significant
underestimation of the mean currents velocity is observed in other regions (Su et al., 2023).
The RMSE, Bias, and ACC curves exhibit significant fluctuations after October 2023, and
the underlying reasons have been thoroughly analyzed in the SST forecast results.
By evaluating the models’ daily forecast performance, the changes in performance over
date can be comprehensively displayed. This helps researchers understand the models’
generalization ability and robustness.
Global horizontal forecasting performance. The global ocean temperature fore
cast results, as depicted in Figure 9, reveal the RMSE distribution for various models with a
lead time of 10 days We observed that all the baseline models exhibit elevated RMSE (> 1.2)
in coastal regions (e.g., western boundary currents and marginal seas) while showing lower
errors (< 0.6) in open tropical oceans (0◦ − 30◦N/S). The global ocean temperature forecast
results demonstrate that the RMSE distributions of all baselines (e.g., ResNet, SwinTrans
former, ClimaX, FourCastNet, PSY4, and XiHe) closely resemble the initial temperature
condition errors. This consistency across models suggests that systematic biases inherent
in the initial field data are preserved during the forecasting process, regardless of the al
gorithmic framework employed. Coastal regions exhibit significantly higher RMSE values
compared to open ocean areas, primarily due to the influence of small- to medium-scale geo
graphical factors. These include nearshore seabed topographical variations, riverine inputs,
and localized tidal dynamics, which drive rapid, spatially heterogeneous temperature fluc
tuations. The RMSE maps reveal concentrated error hotspots along coastlines, reflecting
the inability of current models to fully resolve these localized processes. Although the data
–22

manuscript submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation
driven approach can provide real-time offshore ocean temperature forecasts, the localized
anomalous changes in offshore ocean temperature are significantly influenced by small- and
medium-scale geographic factors, and the relative scarcity of observations related to these
factors makes it difficult to adequately incorporate the observational information on these
influences in the training of the forecast model and in the initial field data. As a result,
such data deficiencies usually adversely affect the effectiveness of purely data-driven models
in forecasting ocean temperature in offshore regions.

time of 10 days calculated on every 1.40625°×1.40625° area. RMSE is computed against
observations taken by EN4.
Vertical forecasting performance. The evaluation experiment on the RMSE of
temperature over vertical depth was conducted to analyze the accuracy of predicting ocean
temperature profiles, which is crucial for understanding oceanic thermal structures and re
lated processes. The analysis of temperature profile forecast results is presented in Figure 10,
which evaluates the performance of various models against temperature profiles taken by
EN4. As shown in Figure 10a, the RMSE/Bias values of all models generally increase as
the lead time extends from 1 to 10 days. PSY4 and XiHe show relatively lower RMSE/Bias
values across most lead times, implying better forecast performance. In contrast, Swin
Transformer have relatively higher RMSE/Bias values, indicating larger errors and biases.
Figure 10b presents the RMSE and Bias of the 10-day forecast as a function of depth. As
the depth increases from the shallow layers to the thermocline (typically 100–200 meters

below the surface), the performance of all models shows a gradual increase in RMSE values,
indicating that the baseline models face significant challenges in forecasting the tempera
ture at the depth of the thermocline. The thermocline is a critical region where temperature
changes sharply with depth, and the rapid variation in temperature makes it difficult for
models to accurately capture the temperature profile. The increase in RMSE values further
suggests that the baseline models face significant challenges in forecasting the tempera
ture within the thermocline. Among all models, XiHe consistently demonstrates the lowest
RMSE values across all depth levels, including within the thermocline region. In contrast,
ResNet and SwinTransformer exhibit higher RMSE values.

Figure 11 presents the forecast accuracy against salinity profiles taken by EN4. From
Figure 11a, it can be observed that the RMSE curves of various models show relatively
small differences. However, when it comes to the ACC metric depicted in Figure 11c and d,
the differences among models become more pronounced. The ACC measures the correlation
between forecasted and observed anomalies, which reflects the model’s ability to capture
the spatial variations of salinity profiles. A higher ACC indicates that the model can better
forecast the variations in salinity profiles. The greater differences in ACC curves at different
depths once again highlight the varying capabilities of models in representing the vertical
structure and variations of salinity profiles. XiHe shows higher ACC values across all depth

Regional forecasting performance. This evaluation experiments were conducted
to assess the models’ spatiotemporal generalization capabilities across diverse ocean basins,
aiming to identify basin-specific performance variations and guide targeted model improve
ments. The global ocean forecast results were divided into distinct basins, including the
North Atlantic, Tropical Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, Tropical Pacific, South
Pacific, Indian Ocean (Ryan et al., 2015). The RMSE metrics for six ocean variables were
calculated separately for each designated basin.
The results presented in Figure 12 illustrate the RMSE distribution of six ocean vari
ables (temperature, salinity, SST, SLA, Uo and Vo) across different ocean basins with a lead
time of 10 days. For temperature forecasts, the RMSE varies across different basins. The
North Atlantic and South Atlantic generally show higher RMSE values compared to other
regions, indicating greater challenges in temperature forecasting in these areas. Among the
models, XiHe demonstrates relatively lower RMSE in most basins, suggesting its better per
formance in capturing temperature variations. In terms of salinity forecasting, the RMSE
distribution shows that the North Atlantic and Tropical Atlantic have relatively higher er
rors. This might be associated with the complex oceanic processes and variability in these
regions. The XiHe also exhibits advantages in salinity forecasting, with lower RMSE values
across multiple basins. The SST forecast results show a different trend to temperature, with
the PSY4 performing best overall. The differences in RMSE values across different ocean
basins are significant. For example, there is a notable disparity in SST forecast performance
between the Tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic. Regarding SLA, the RMSE tends to
be higher in the South Atlantic and North Atlantic. The performance of different models in
SLA forecasting varies, with XiHe and PSY4 achieving relatively lower RMSE values across
several basins. In the case of Uo and Vo, the RMSE distribution indicates that forecast
ing ocean currents remains challenging, especially in the Indian Ocean. The ResNet shows
some superiority in currents velocity forecasting, with lower RMSE values in multiple ocean
basins.

5 Conclusion
We introduce OceanForecastBench, an open-source benchmark for training and evalu
ating data-driven models to forecast key ocean variables, including SLA, SST, temperature,
salinity, and currents. For model training, OceanForecastBench provides a standardized
training dataset with consistent spatial and temporal resolution, spanning the past 28 years.
This dataset is derived from over 13 TB of raw reanalysis data, with GLORYS12 serving as
the primary source. To improve the representation of air-sea interactions, the training set
also incorporates sea surface wind fields from ERA5 and SST data from OSTIA. For model
evaluation, OceanForecastBench provides a robust evaluation dataset containing over 100
million observations collected from satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements. A
standardized evaluation pipeline is developed to align forecast outputs with observational
data in spatialtemporal dimension and to compute performance metrics in a consistent
manner. This benchmark evaluate six baseline models, encompassing both operational nu
merical forecasting systems and advanced deep learning models, offering an in-depth com
parison of their capabilities. The results highlight the respective strengths and limitations
of each model, offering guidance for future methodological improvements. OceanForecast
Bench standardizes both the training and evaluation processes, simplifies data processing
workflows, and lowers the barrier for interdisciplinary engagement in data-driven ocean fore
casting research. This benchmark provides a foundation for future developments in ocean
