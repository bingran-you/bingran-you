## When to invoke this skill

Use when you want to widen edit scope without ending the session.
Use when asked to "unfreeze", "unlock edits", "remove freeze", or
"allow all edits".

# /unfreeze — Clear Freeze Boundary

Remove the edit restriction set by `/freeze`, allowing edits to all directories.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"unfreeze","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Clear the boundary

```bash
bash "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/freeze/bin/freeze-state.sh" clear
```

This is explicit user-requested removal, not investigation cleanup. The shared writer serializes it with acquisition, replacement and owner-checked release. On `FREEZE_BUSY` or unexpected state, leave everything untouched and report recovery; never delete state or a possibly active mutation lock directly.

Tell the user the result. Note that `/freeze` hooks are still registered for the
session — they will just allow everything since no state file exists. To re-freeze,
run `/freeze` again.
