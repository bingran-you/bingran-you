## When to invoke this skill

Detects global vs vendored install,
runs the upgrade, and shows what's new. Use when asked to "upgrade gstack",
"update gstack", or "get latest version".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "upgrade the tools", "update the tools", "gee stack upgrade", "g stack upgrade".

# /gstack-upgrade

Upgrade gstack to the latest version and show what's new.

## Inline upgrade flow

This section is referenced by all skill preambles when they detect `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE`.

### Step 1: Ask the user (or auto-upgrade)

First, check if auto-upgrade is enabled:
```bash
_AUTO=""
[ "${GSTACK_AUTO_UPGRADE:-}" = "1" ] && _AUTO="true"
[ -z "$_AUTO" ] && _AUTO=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get auto_upgrade 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "AUTO_UPGRADE=$_AUTO"
```

**If `AUTO_UPGRADE=true` or `AUTO_UPGRADE=1`:** Skip AskUserQuestion. Log "Auto-upgrading gstack v{old} → v{new}..." and proceed directly to Step 2. If `./setup` fails during auto-upgrade, restore from backup (`.bak` directory) and warn the user: "Auto-upgrade failed — restored previous version. Run `/gstack-upgrade` manually to retry."

**Otherwise**, use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "gstack **v{new}** is available (you're on v{old}). Upgrade now?"
- Options: ["Yes, upgrade now", "Always keep me up to date", "Not now", "Never ask again"]

**If "Yes, upgrade now":** Proceed to Step 2.

**If "Always keep me up to date":**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set auto_upgrade true
```
Tell user: "Auto-upgrade enabled. Future updates will install automatically." Then proceed to Step 2.

**If "Not now":** Write snooze state with escalating backoff (first snooze = 24h, second = 48h, third+ = 1 week), then continue with the current skill. Do not mention the upgrade again.
```bash
_SNOOZE_FILE="$HOME/.gstack/update-snoozed"
_REMOTE_VER="{new}"
_CUR_LEVEL=0
if [ -f "$_SNOOZE_FILE" ]; then
  _SNOOZED_VER=$(awk '{print $1}' "$_SNOOZE_FILE")
  if [ "$_SNOOZED_VER" = "$_REMOTE_VER" ]; then
    _CUR_LEVEL=$(awk '{print $2}' "$_SNOOZE_FILE")
    case "$_CUR_LEVEL" in *[!0-9]*) _CUR_LEVEL=0 ;; esac
  fi
fi
_NEW_LEVEL=$((_CUR_LEVEL + 1))
[ "$_NEW_LEVEL" -gt 3 ] && _NEW_LEVEL=3
echo "$_REMOTE_VER $_NEW_LEVEL $(date +%s)" > "$_SNOOZE_FILE"
```
Note: `{new}` is the remote version from the `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` output — substitute it from the update check result.

Tell user the snooze duration: "Next reminder in 24h" (or 48h or 1 week, depending on level). Tip: "Set `auto_upgrade: true` in `~/.gstack/config.yaml` for automatic upgrades."

**If "Never ask again":**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set update_check false
```
Tell user: "Update checks disabled. Run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set update_check true` to re-enable."
Continue with the current skill.

### Step 2: Detect install type

```bash
if [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="global-git"
  INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d "$HOME/.gstack/repos/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="global-git"
  INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.gstack/repos/gstack"
elif [ -d ".claude/skills/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="local-git"
  INSTALL_DIR=".claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d ".agents/skills/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="local-git"
  INSTALL_DIR=".agents/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d ".claude/skills/gstack" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="vendored"
  INSTALL_DIR=".claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="vendored-global"
  INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
else
  echo "ERROR: gstack not found"
  exit 1
fi
echo "Install type: $INSTALL_TYPE at $INSTALL_DIR"
```

The install type and directory path printed above will be used in all subsequent steps.

### Step 3: Save old version

Use the install directory from Step 2's output below:

```bash
OLD_VERSION=$(cat "$INSTALL_DIR/VERSION" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
```

### Step 4: Upgrade

Use the install type and directory detected in Step 2:

**For git installs** (global-git, local-git):

Fast-forward first (#2517) — the same policy the session-update auto-upgrade
uses. `--autostash` carries local edits over the pull; render-footprint dirt
is discarded first because it is regenerable and poisons stashes (#2569):
```bash
cd "$INSTALL_DIR"
# Discard render-footprint dirt (#2569): pre-v1.67 gbrain-enabled installs
# ran gen:skill-docs:user IN PLACE, leaving generated SKILL.md / sections
# files permanently modified. They are regenerable (setup re-renders to
# ~/.gstack/render), so discarding is lossless.
git checkout -- 'SKILL.md' '*/SKILL.md' '*/sections/*.md' 2>/dev/null || true
git fetch origin
git pull --ff-only --autostash origin main && ./setup && echo "FF_OK"
```

If the output ends with `FF_OK`, the upgrade is done — skip the fallback
below entirely.

**Fallback (ff-only refused — local commits or divergence).** `git reset
--hard` DESTROYS things: a clean tree with unpushed local commits still loses
those commits. Gate it (#2517):

1. Run `git status --porcelain` and `git rev-list origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
   in `$INSTALL_DIR`.
2. If BOTH are empty, the reset is provably safe — run the fallback block
   below without asking.
3. Otherwise ask via AskUserQuestion (one-way door — destructive), listing
   exactly what will be discarded: each dirty file and each unpushed commit
   by hash + subject. Options: **A)** Discard them and upgrade (reset) —
   requires the explicit letter; **B)** Abort the upgrade so the user can
   rescue their work first (recommended when local commits exist). Never
   proceed on a vague reply.

```bash
cd "$INSTALL_DIR"
STASH_OUTPUT=$(git stash 2>&1)
git reset --hard origin/main
./setup
```
If `$STASH_OUTPUT` contains "Saved working directory", warn the user: "Note: local changes were stashed (any modified generated SKILL.md/sections files were discarded first — they regenerate on setup). Run `git stash pop` in the skill directory to restore your own changes."

**For vendored installs** (vendored, vendored-global):
```bash
PARENT=$(dirname "$INSTALL_DIR")
# A stale .bak from a previously crashed upgrade would make the mv below NEST
# the live install inside it and the failure-restore arm would "restore" the
# stale backup. It may also be the only good copy from that crashed run —
# abort and let the human inspect, never delete it silently.
[ -e "$INSTALL_DIR.bak" ] && { echo "ERROR: stale backup exists at $INSTALL_DIR.bak (from a previous failed upgrade?) — inspect it, salvage/remove it, then re-run." >&2; exit 1; }
TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d) || { echo "ERROR: mktemp failed — aborting upgrade (install untouched)." >&2; exit 1; }
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git "$TMP_DIR/gstack" || { echo "ERROR: clone failed — aborting upgrade (install untouched)." >&2; rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"; exit 1; }
mv "$INSTALL_DIR" "$INSTALL_DIR.bak"
if mv "$TMP_DIR/gstack" "$INSTALL_DIR"; then
  cd "$INSTALL_DIR" && ./setup
  rm -rf "$INSTALL_DIR.bak" "$TMP_DIR"
else
  mv "$INSTALL_DIR.bak" "$INSTALL_DIR"
  echo "ERROR: swap failed — previous install restored; upgrade aborted." >&2
  rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Step 4.5: Handle local vendored copy

Use the install directory from Step 2. Check if there's also a local vendored copy, and whether team mode is active:

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
LOCAL_GSTACK=""
if [ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -d "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack" ]; then
  _RESOLVED_LOCAL=$(cd "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack" && pwd -P)
  _RESOLVED_PRIMARY=$(cd "$INSTALL_DIR" && pwd -P)
  if [ "$_RESOLVED_LOCAL" != "$_RESOLVED_PRIMARY" ]; then
    LOCAL_GSTACK="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack"
  fi
fi
_TEAM_MODE=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get team_mode 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
echo "LOCAL_GSTACK=$LOCAL_GSTACK"
echo "TEAM_MODE=$_TEAM_MODE"
```

**If `LOCAL_GSTACK` is non-empty AND `TEAM_MODE` is `true`:** Remove the vendored copy. Team mode uses the global install as the single source of truth.

```bash
cd "$_ROOT"
git rm -r --cached .claude/skills/gstack/ 2>/dev/null || true
if ! grep -qF '.claude/skills/gstack/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
  echo '.claude/skills/gstack/' >> .gitignore
fi
rm -rf "$LOCAL_GSTACK"
```
Tell user: "Removed vendored copy at `$LOCAL_GSTACK` (team mode active — global install is the source of truth). Commit the `.gitignore` change when ready."

**If `LOCAL_GSTACK` is non-empty AND `TEAM_MODE` is NOT `true`:** Update it by copying from the freshly-upgraded primary install (same approach as README vendored install):
```bash
mv "$LOCAL_GSTACK" "$LOCAL_GSTACK.bak"
cp -Rf "$INSTALL_DIR" "$LOCAL_GSTACK"
rm -rf "$LOCAL_GSTACK/.git"
cd "$LOCAL_GSTACK" && ./setup
rm -rf "$LOCAL_GSTACK.bak"
```
Tell user: "Also updated vendored copy at `$LOCAL_GSTACK` — commit `.claude/skills/gstack/` when you're ready."

If `./setup` fails, restore from backup and warn the user:
```bash
rm -rf "$LOCAL_GSTACK"
mv "$LOCAL_GSTACK.bak" "$LOCAL_GSTACK"
```
Tell user: "Sync failed — restored previous version at `$LOCAL_GSTACK`. Run `/gstack-upgrade` manually to retry."

### Step 4.75: Run version migrations

After `./setup` completes, run any migration scripts for versions between the old
and new version. Migrations handle state fixes that `./setup` alone can't cover
(stale config, orphaned files, directory structure changes).

```bash
MIGRATIONS_DIR="$INSTALL_DIR/gstack-upgrade/migrations"
if [ -d "$MIGRATIONS_DIR" ]; then
  for migration in $(find "$MIGRATIONS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name 'v*.sh' -type f 2>/dev/null | sort -V); do
    # Extract version from filename: v0.15.2.0.sh → 0.15.2.0
    m_ver="$(basename "$migration" .sh | sed 's/^v//')"
    # Run if this migration version is newer than old version
    # (simple string compare works for dotted versions with same segment count)
    if [ "$OLD_VERSION" != "unknown" ] && [ "$(printf '%s\n%s' "$OLD_VERSION" "$m_ver" | sort -V | head -1)" = "$OLD_VERSION" ] && [ "$OLD_VERSION" != "$m_ver" ]; then
      echo "Running migration $m_ver..."
      # GSTACK_INSTALL_DIR: migrations that clean the INSTALL (not just
      # ~/.gstack state) default to ~/.claude/skills/gstack when unset —
      # a repo-local install would silently no-op without this.
      GSTACK_INSTALL_DIR="$INSTALL_DIR" bash "$migration" || echo "  Warning: migration $m_ver had errors (non-fatal)"
    fi
  done
fi
```

Migrations are idempotent bash scripts in `gstack-upgrade/migrations/`. Each is named
`v{VERSION}.sh` and runs only when upgrading from an older version. See CONTRIBUTING.md
for how to add new migrations.

### Step 4.8: Stop any stale daemon (unconditional)

A browse daemon started before the upgrade keeps serving the OLD binary's code
until it is stopped — it survives `git reset --hard` and `./setup` because the
running process holds the old executable (#2551). Always run this step, using
the install directory detected in Step 2.

```bash
INSTALL_DIR_PLACEHOLDER="<install dir from Step 2>"
NEW_HASH=$(cat "$INSTALL_DIR_PLACEHOLDER/browse/dist/.version" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
_STATE_FILE="${BROWSE_STATE_FILE:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.gstack/browse.json}"
if [ -z "$NEW_HASH" ] || [ ! -f "$_STATE_FILE" ]; then
  echo "DAEMON_CHECK=none (no state file or no fresh build hash)"
else
  DAEMON_PID=$(sed -n 's/.*"pid"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*\([0-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/p' "$_STATE_FILE" | head -1)
  DAEMON_PORT=$(sed -n 's/.*"port"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*\([0-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/p' "$_STATE_FILE" | head -1)
  OLD_HASH=$(sed -n 's/.*"binaryVersion"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$_STATE_FILE" | head -1)
  if [ -z "$DAEMON_PID" ] || ! kill -0 "$DAEMON_PID" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "DAEMON_CHECK=dead (no live daemon to stop)"
  elif [ "$OLD_HASH" = "$NEW_HASH" ]; then
    echo "DAEMON_CHECK=current (daemon already runs the new binary)"
  elif curl -fsS --max-time 2 "http://127.0.0.1:$DAEMON_PORT/health" 2>/dev/null | grep -q '"status":"healthy"'; then
    echo "DAEMON_CHECK=stale-responsive pid=$DAEMON_PID hash=${OLD_HASH:-unknown} -> $NEW_HASH"
    "$INSTALL_DIR_PLACEHOLDER/browse/dist/browse" stop && echo "DAEMON_STOPPED=yes"
  else
    echo "DAEMON_CHECK=stale-busy pid=$DAEMON_PID hash=${OLD_HASH:-unknown} -> $NEW_HASH"
  fi
fi
```

Replace `<install dir from Step 2>` with the actual install directory before
running. Interpret the `DAEMON_CHECK` result:

1. **`stale-responsive` + `DAEMON_STOPPED=yes`:** Tell the user "Stopped the
   old browse daemon (binary {OLD_HASH} → {NEW_HASH}). The next browse command
   starts a fresh daemon on the new binary."
2. **`stale-busy`:** The daemon runs the old binary but is mid-work — DEFER to
   it, never kill a busy daemon during upgrade. Tell the user: "A browse daemon
   is still running the pre-upgrade binary ({OLD_HASH} → {NEW_HASH}) but is
   busy right now. When it finishes, stop it with `browse stop` — or force it
   immediately with `browse --force-restart stop` (loses that session's
   tabs/cookies/logins)."
3. **`none` / `dead` / `current`:** Nothing to do — say nothing.

### Step 5: Write marker + clear cache

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack
echo "$OLD_VERSION" > ~/.gstack/just-upgraded-from
rm -f ~/.gstack/last-update-check
rm -f ~/.gstack/update-snoozed
```

### Step 6: Show What's New

Read `$INSTALL_DIR/CHANGELOG.md`. Find all version entries between the old version and the new version. Summarize as 5-7 bullets grouped by theme. Don't overwhelm — focus on user-facing changes. Skip internal refactors unless they're significant.

Format:
```
gstack v{new} — upgraded from v{old}!

What's new:
- [bullet 1]
- [bullet 2]
- ...

Happy shipping!
```

### Step 7: Continue

After showing What's New, continue with whatever skill the user originally invoked. The upgrade is done — no further action needed.

## Standalone usage

When invoked directly as `/gstack-upgrade` (not from a preamble):

1. Force a fresh update check (bypass cache):
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check --force 2>/dev/null || \
.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-update-check --force 2>/dev/null || true
```
Use the output to determine if an upgrade is available.

2. If `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: follow Steps 2-6 above.

3. If no output (primary is up to date): check for a stale local vendored copy.

Run the Step 2 bash block above to detect the primary install type and directory (`INSTALL_TYPE` and `INSTALL_DIR`). Then run the Step 4.5 detection bash block above to check for a local vendored copy (`LOCAL_GSTACK`) and team mode status (`TEAM_MODE`).

**If `LOCAL_GSTACK` is empty** (no local vendored copy): tell the user "You're already on the latest version (v{version})."

**If `LOCAL_GSTACK` is non-empty AND `TEAM_MODE` is `true`:** Remove the vendored copy using the Step 4.5 team-mode removal bash block above. Tell user: "Global v{version} is up to date. Removed stale vendored copy (team mode active). Commit the `.gitignore` change when ready."

**If `LOCAL_GSTACK` is non-empty AND `TEAM_MODE` is NOT `true`**, compare versions:
```bash
PRIMARY_VER=$(cat "$INSTALL_DIR/VERSION" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
LOCAL_VER=$(cat "$LOCAL_GSTACK/VERSION" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "PRIMARY=$PRIMARY_VER LOCAL=$LOCAL_VER"
```

**If versions differ:** follow the Step 4.5 sync bash block above to update the local copy from the primary. Tell user: "Global v{PRIMARY_VER} is up to date. Updated local vendored copy from v{LOCAL_VER} → v{PRIMARY_VER}. Commit `.claude/skills/gstack/` when you're ready."

**If versions match:** tell the user "You're on the latest version (v{PRIMARY_VER}). Global and local vendored copy are both up to date."
